　　Waiter: Well, the crab salad's always a big hit.
　　Harry: Susan, would you like the crab salad?
　　Susan: I'd love the crab salad.
　　Harry: Michelle, would you like to try the crab salad, too?
　　Michelle: OK, Daddy.
　　Harry: We'll have three crab salads and a pitcher of lemonade.
　　Waiter: Help yourself to celery and carrots and other vegetables.
　　Harry: We used to catch crabs.
　　Susan: Where was that?
　　Harry: We had a summer house on Fire island. Do you remember, Michelle?
　　Michelle: Sure. You and Mommy used to take me on the ferryboat.
　　Harry: Sometimes, at night, we would go down to the beach and catch crabs, remember?
　　Michelle: With a piece of meat on a string!
　　Harry: Right. Well, I think I'm going to go get us all some vegetables.
　　Waiter: There you go.
　　Susan: Thank you.
　　Waiter: And some ice-cold lemonade.
　　Susan: Thank you.
　　Waiter: Enjoy it.
　　Susan: Michelle, can I help you with the lemonade?
　　Michelle: No, thank you, I'll wait for my father.
　　Susan: Michelle, can we have a talk?
　　Michelle: Sure.
　　Susan: I know you miss your mother.
　　Michelle: You do? Susan: Yes. And I'm not trying to take her place.
　　Michelle: Then why are you and Daddy spending so much time together?
　　Susan: Because we like each other. And right now, he needs a friend.
　　Michelle: I'm his friend.
　　Susan: I know you are.
　　Michelle: Sometimes he's very sad.
　　Susan: And so are you, I think.
　　Michelle: Sometimes.
　　Susan: I'd like to be your friend, too. Will you let me be your friend, Michelle?
　　Harry: So, what were you two talking about?
　　Michelle: Just girl talk, daddy. It's too hard to explain.
　　Harry: You're probably right. Well, let's get started.
　　Act 3.
　　Susan: Oh, it's a quarter to four, and I have a production meeting at four.
　　Harry: I planned to take you for a ride in Central Park in a horse and carriage.
　　Susan: Harry, I'd love to , but I have work to do.
　　Harry: OK. We'll walk back to your office with you. It's so nice out. I decided to forget about my accounting problems and just enjoy this beautiful spring day. Take the time, Susan.
　　Susan: I know I should, but... well, there are too many things to do.
　　Harry; I understand. I'll go for a ride with Michelle.
　　Susan: Right. Well, I had a really nice time.
　　Harry: So did I.
　　Michelle: So did I. I'm sorry you can't come with us, Susan.
　　Susan: So am I.
　　Harry: Bye-bye.
　　Susan: Harry! Michelle! Can you wait till I make a phone call?
　　Harry; Sure.
　　Sam: Susan Stewart's office.
　　Susan: Sam, this is Susan.
　　Sam: Hi. How was lunch?
　　Susan: Fine.
　　Sam: You're late. The production department's waiting in the conference room.
　　Susan: I know. Ask Paul Smith to fill in for me. He knows everything about the production schedule, and he can answer any questions.
　　Sam: Right.
　　Susan: Don't tell anyone, but I'm taking a little time to smell the flowers.
　　Sam: Good for you. It'll be our secret.
　　Susan: But schedule another production meeting for tomorrow. I'll be back for my six o'clock appointment with Mr. Ozawa.
　　Sam: OK, Susan. And have a nice afternoon.
　　Susan: Thanks
　　Harry: She likes you.
　　Susan: I know. I like her.
　　Harry: How'd you do it?
　　Susan: We had a talk.
　　Harry: About what?
　　Susan: Life.
　　harry: And what did you decide?
　　Susan: That's a secret...between us women.
　　Episode 11 A Place of Our Own
　　Act 1.
　　Marilyn: Ellen, I'd like your opinion
　　Ellen: About what?
　　Marilyn: Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming we need to have our own place to live.
　　Ellen: Oh.
　　Marilyn: Well, what do you think about Richard and me looking for a small house or an apartmnt at this point in our lives?
　　Ellen: We love having you here, and there is room, and...and when the baby comes, the baby can stay in your room for a while.
　　Marilyn: Richard feels we need to find a small house.
　　Ellen: I remember when I was pregnant with Richard. Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa. Philip was a young doctor, and he kept talking about having a house of our own. It's natural.
　　Marilyn: What did you do ?
　　Ellen: We looked at a lot of houses.
　　Marilyn: Did you find one?
　　Ellen: Oh, not at first. We couldn't afford it. Grandpa wanted to led us the money to buy one, but Philip is too independent. He didn't want to borrow any money.
　　Marilyn: Sounds like Richard.
　　Ellen: They're all alike. Richard is a real Stewart. He's independent, and sometimes just stubbom.
　　Marilyn: When did you buy a house?
　　Ellen: After Richard was born. I was teaching music, and Philip was opening his first medical office.
　　Marilyn: Where was the house?
　　Ellen: Right here in Riverdate. Of course, it was a small house, but just right for us.
　　Marilyn: It's funny. History repeats itself. Now Richard and I are having a baby, and we probably won't be able to afford a house right away, either.
　　Ellen: Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn?
　　Marilyn: Good idea.
　　Ellen: Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times. You'll learn a lot.
　　Marilyn: Maybe we should speak to a real-estate agent about a house.
　　Ellen: And a bank about a mortgage.
　　Marilyn: I'll talk to Richard about it. I think it's a good idea, Ellen. We can learn a lot by asking.
　　Ellen: And if I can be of any help, let me know. As a matter of fact, my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.
　　Marilyn: Good.
　　Ellen: You won't believe this, but she sold us our first house and this one.
　　Marilyn: Well, I'll tell Richard, and we'll go to see her. Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen? Do you think it's too long?
　　Ellen: I think the skirt is just right. Are you planning to attach a train to it?
　　Marilyn: No. No train. Just the dress. But I am going to make a headpiece of lace.
　　Ellen: That dress is gorgeous.
　　Marilyn: Thanks, Ellen. And thanks for the advice about the house. I'll talk to Richard about it the minute the comes home.
　　Ellen: And remember, we love having you here. There's no need to rush.
　　Act 2.
　　Virginia: I remember yuor parents' first house very well. It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.
　　Richard: I grew up in that house.
　　Virginia: Yes, and you were such a cute baby.
　　Marilyn : I've seen pictures of him. He had blond hair.
　　Virginia: I've been friendly with the Stewart family for a long time, so It's my pleasure to help you find a house now.
　　Richard: Well, we're not sure we can afford one.
　　Marilyn: But we'd like to find ut about the possibilities.
　　Virginia: That's a good idea. I love your house on Linden Street. I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.
　　Marilyn: Really?
　　Richard: Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then, and they needed the extra room.
　　Virginia: I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs.Stewart.
　　Marilyn: Mmm-hmm. So we will be needing more room.
　　Virginia: Oh, so you don't need something immediately?
　　Richard: No. But in five or six months...
　　Marilyn: And time passes so quickly.
　　Virginia: Yes, it does. Well, when you called, you gave me enough information about your salaries and your savings. So I have a good idea about your financial situation. Let me show your some pictures of houses.
　　Marilyn: With two bedrooms?
　　Virginia: Yes, I think I can show you some. Of course, they won't be in Riverdale. The cost of housing's too high for you here.
　　Richard: I haven't thought about living anywhere else. We've always lived in this area.
　　Marilyn: Where should we look for a house, Mrs.Martinelli?
　　Virginia: Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco. It's a lovely area, and it's only about an hour's rive from here. Here. I have a book with photos of some homes in that area. Now, let's see. Here. This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.
　　Marilyn: It's pretty, but I prefer a two-story home.
　　Richard: I do, too. I don't care for a ranch type.
　　Virginia: OK. Oh, this is a wonderful house. I know it well. I sold it to the present owners.
　　Richard: It looks wonderful.
　　Virginia: This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house. It has a full basement, and it is on a half- acre lot. You can probably afford this one.
　　Marilyn: I like this house.
　　Richard: So do I.
　　Virginia: And the price is right. Would you like to go see it?
　　Richard: Yes. We're planning to talk to someone at the bank next week. Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.
　　Virginia: If some one doesn't buy it before then. But let's keep looking. Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.
　　Richard: This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.
　　Virginia: Here. This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.
　　Richard: Oh, I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.
　　Marilyn: It looks like the houses in Hollywood.
　　Virginia: It's interesting. A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price. Oh my! Here's a real buy. It's a bargain. This house just came on the market.
　　Marilyn: It's quite lovely. Is it a two-bedroom house?
　　Virginia: No. It has three bedrooms and three baths. I know the house. It has a brand new kitchen. And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. And there's a two-car garage.
　　Richard: Then why don't we go look at this house, too?
　　Virginia: It's a good investment.
　　Richard: Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.
　　Marilyn: Thanks so much.
　　Virginia: My pleasure. Give my best to your parents.
　　Virginia: Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard. He took care of my daughter when she was a child. He's the best pediatrician in Westchester.
　　Richard: Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli, I'll give them your regards.
　　Marilyn: We really appreciate your advice.
　　Virginia: I do think you should go see the houses and talk to the bank. Here. Let me give you some information sheets abo the houses. They're both very good buys.
　　Richard: Well, thanks so much for your help and your time, Mrs. Martinelli. We've got a lot to talk about.
　　Marilyn: Mmm-hmm. Thanks.
　　Act 3.
　　Mr.Riley: How do you do?
　　Richard: Hello.
　　Mr.Riley: I'm Ralph Riley.
　　Richard: I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.
　　Mr.Riley: Pleased to meet you.
　　Marilyn: Likewise, Mr.Riley.
　　MR.Riley: Please, sit down. What can I do for you?
　　Richard: We'd like to discuss a mortgage.
　　Marilyn: For a house.
　　Mr.Riley: Fine. Are you buying a house or are you reinancing your present home?
　　Richard: We're planning to buy a house.
　　Marilyn: And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.
　　Richard: We are customers of the bank. As a matter of fact, my whole Family banks here.
　　Mr.Riley: I have some questions to ask. Do you own your house or do you rent?
　　Richard: Neither. We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.
　　Mr.Riley: And how old are you?
　　Marilyn: I'm twenty-nine.
　　Richard: I'm thirty.
　　Mr.RIley: And, Mr. Stewat, what is your occupation?
　　RIchard: I'm a freelance photographer.
　　Mr.Riley: And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?
　　Marilyn: Yes. I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.
　　Mr.Riley: Did you bring any savings or salary information? Last year's tax forms?
　　Richard: Yes. Here they are.
　　Mr. Riley: OK. What...what kind of house did you have in mind?
　　Richard: We're talking about buying a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco. Here are the financial details on the house.
　　Mr.Riley: Thank you. Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?
　　Richard: Yes, we are.
　　Mr.Riley: Payments over thirty years?
　　Richard: Yes.
　　Marilyn: Do you think we can get a loan?
　　Mr.Riley: Well, it depends. Do you own any other property? Any stocks or bonds?
　　Richard: No.
　　Mr.Riley: I see. Then you don't have any collateral. Perhaps you could get a guarantor- someone to sign for the loan for you.
　　Richard: Why is that necessary?
　　Mr.Riley: Since you don't have enough income, and you don't already own any property, the bank needs to be sure you can pay the mortgage every month. A guarantor is responsible for the loan if you can't make the payments.
　　Richard: I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.
　　Marilyn: Thank you, Mr.Riley. We'll read this over carefully.
　　Mr.Riley: Thank you.
　　Richard: Good-bye. Thanks.
　　Mr.Riley: Godd-bye. And hope to see you soon.
　　Richard: I hope so, too.
　　Mr.Riley: Take care.
　　Marilyn: Good-bye.
　　Richard: It all sounded so easy until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.
　　Marilyn: We have no collateral.
　　Richard: And I don't think it's a good idea to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor. I don't feel right about it.
　　Marilyn: I understand your feelings about it, Richard.
　　Ellen: Now, tell me, what's the problem?
　　Marilyn: We can get a loan from the bank if we can put up some collateral.
　　Richard: And we don't own anything to use as collateral.
　　Marilyn: Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.
　　Ellen: Why don't you speak to Dad?
　　Richard: No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.
　　Ellen: Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.
　　Marilyn: I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.
　　Richard: In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book and be able to put more money down.
　　Marilyn: What about the house in Mount Kisco? Somebody else'll buy it by then.
　　Richard: Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.
　　Ellen: Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look.
　　Marilyn: We're in no great rush. It's true.
　　Richard: This has been a great learning experience for us, Marilyn. Talking to the real-estate agent. Looking at the houses. Talking to the loan officer at the bank.
　　Marilyn: It has been a learning experience. That's true.
　　Ellen: I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time. Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind. You're talking about a lot of money.
　　Marilyn: We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.
　　Richard: And I'll call Mr.Riley at the bank and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.
　　Ellen: And if you ever need Dad or me to help you...
　　Marilyn: We know.
　　Ellen: You know we'll be there for you.
　　Richard: It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family.
　　Episode 12 You're Tops
　　Act 1.
　　Grandpa: Is that you, Susan?
　　Susan: It's me, Grandpa.
　　Grandpa: Am I glad to see you!
　　Susan: And am I glad to see you! I am also glad to be here.
　　Grandpa: How are things?
　　Susan: I have been talking to a group of salesmen since ten this morning, and I'm real exhausted.
　　Grandpa: Well, you look good. What's Harry doing tonight?
　　Susan: He and Michelle are visiting relatives in New Jersey today.
　　Grandpa: The rest of our family went to the movies. So it's just you and me, Susan.
　　Susan: It's nice to be alone with you, Grandpa. We don't get to see enough of each other.
　　Grandpa: Oh, I feel the same way, Susan. I miss seeing you. But to tell the truth, next time I'd like to go into the city and meet you there, instead of you coming here.
　　Susan: You don't need to do that, Grandpa.
　　Grandpa: Yeah, I do. I need to get out more. Well, I mean there's a lot to do around the house, and I love being here with the family, you know, but I'm restless. Since I retired, I've got extra time on my hands.
　　Susan: I understand, Grandpa.
　　Grandpa: I think you do. Frankly, I'd like to use my brain a little more.
　　Susan: Grandpa, you have so much energy and so many years of experience. There are probably a lot of places for you to work. Particularly in the construction field.
　　Grandpa: But at my age, I'm not looking for a full-time job. I'm retired. But I'm bored.
　　Susan: Well, there must be something. Maybe I can help.
　　Grandpa: Let's go into the kitchen, and maybe can help me set the table.
　　Susan: Sounds good to me. What are we having?
　　Grandpa: I prepared lamb chops, mashed potatoes, and a tossed green salad to begin with.
　　Susan: Grandpa, you are a terrific guy!
　　Susan: You're still thinking about something to do, aren't you? A job of some kind.
　　Grandpa: That's right. I've been thinking about it for weeks now .There must be some way to put my mind to good use.
　　Susan: We'll find a solution. A positive solution to your finding a way to use that wonderful mind of yours.
　　Act 2.
　　Susan: Sam, would you come in ,please?
　　Sam: You sound like something's brothering you, Susan. The sketches for the cover of the new doll book?
　　Susan: That's not it. Please sit down.
　　Sam: Sure.
　　Susan: I need your advice on a personal matter, but it's not about me.
　　Sam: You need my advice on a personal matter, and it's not about. OK.
　　Susan: It's about my grandfather.
　　Sam: What's the problem?
　　Susan: It won't sound like a big deal, but it is. I had dinner with him Saturday, and he's very unhappy about not working.
　　Sam: I thought he was retired and pleased to be living with the family.
　　Susan: He is, but there's so much energy and talent in the man ,and he doesn't get to use it.
　　Sam: But what can I do? What kind of advice are you looking for?
　　Susan: Simply this. John Marchetta runs this company.
　　Sam: He founded this company.
　　Susan: Right. John Marchetta Gave me my start here six years ago, when I first graduated from college. He gave me the chance to use my talents and made me feel more confident.
　　Sam: Right. Maybe he can do the same thing for your grandfather.
　　Susan: Or at least give him some advice.
　　Sam: Right. Then I've solved your problem.
　　Susan: I can always depend on you, Sam.
　　Sam: I'm glad to help. Shall I call Mr. Marchetta for you?
　　Susan: No, no. I'll do that. Thanks.
　　Sam: Now, how's the Stewart family?
　　Susan: Fine, thank you, Mr. Marchetta. Except for my grandfather.
　　Sam: What's wrong, Susan? What's wrong with him?
　　Susan: He needs to work. In fact, that is the reason why I'm here to see you. I know you're building a new factory, and I thought...may be...my grandfather is so experienced in the construction trade, he could be so valuable.
　　Sam: Tell him to come and see me at ten 0'clock tomorrow morning. I have an idea that may solve the problem for him and help a lot of other people.
　　Susan: Really, Mr.Marchetta? Can I tell him that?
　　Marchetta: Sure can. Ten 0'clock in the morning. Here.
　　Susan: Oh, thank you!
　　Act 3.
　　Grandpa: Hi. I'm Malcolm Stewart.
　　Marchetta: John Marchetta. Sit down, sit down.
　　Grandpa: Susan has told me a great deal about you.She says you're quite a man.
　　Marchetta: She says a lot of wonderful things about you too, Mr. Stewart.
　　Grandpa: That's always nice to hear, Mr.Marchetta.
　　Marchetta: Call me John. May I call you Malcolm?
　　Marchetta; Let's talk business.
　　Grandpa: That's music to my ears.
　　Marchetta: I understand you used to be in the construction business.
　　Grandpa: Yup. Forty-three years. Here's a brief description of forty three years of on-the-job training.
　　Marchetta: That is some history! You're a valuable asset, Malcolm. Very valuable.
　　Grandpa: Thank you. Yup. Forty-three years. Half that time in my own construction company. Big jobs-factories, shopping malls. That kind of thing.
　　Marchetta: Then you retired.
　　Grandpa: Yes. After my wife died, and I felt I should spend more time with my children and grandchildren. I live in Florida, and they lived in New York.
　　Marchetta: I understand. My daughter Cami lives in NewYork. I like being near her.
　　Grandpa: When I came here, I planned to take a few months off. Relax with the family and then look for some work. Put my experience on the line...but, unfortunately, there isn't any work for a retired person my age.
　　Marchetta: Sometimes there is, and sometimes there isn't. Well, I'm evolved with an organization, and we're trying to resolve that problem.
　　Grandpa: What's that?
　　Marchetta: TOPS. T-O-P-S- means Talented Older People's Society.
　　Grandpa: I'd like to be a member. How much are the dues?
　　Marchetta: There are no dues...The organization serves major men and women like you. Experienced, talented, retired. But our members want to go out there and use their talents. They want to work.
　　Grandpa: That fantastic, John!
　　Marchetta: I've got and idea for you, Malcolm. Just fill out this form for me. It'll only take a few minutes. Sit right here, and do it while I talk to my secretary. When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory. My company is a member of TOPS. So I try hard to find opportunities for people like it. Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now. Have you got time this morning to go over to the construction site with me? I'd like to have you meet my foreman-get some background on the job.
　　Grandpa: I've got plenty of time.
　　Marchetta: I'll be right back. We'll go over to the job site together.
　　Danny: Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project?
　　Grandpa: My company was the contractor. I built the theater there with my own two hands, practically.
　　Danny: I understand.
　　Marchrtta: Well, I'm glad to see you two guys getting along so well because Danny, Malcolm is on the TOPS team. He's going to be working with you for a while. His experience will be valuable to both of us.
　　Danny: Welcome aboard, Malcolm!
　　Marchetta: I'm going back to my office. Give me a call later, Malcolm. I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting. I'd like you to meet the group.
　　Grandpa: I will, John. And again-thanks.
　　Marchetta: No...thank you. And thank Susan.
　　Grandpa: He's quite a man.
　　Danny: A real inspiration for me.
　　Grandpa: OK, Danny. I know you didn't expect to have me around, but I think I can be of some help to you.
　　Danny: Let me tell you something, Malcolm. With your background and experience, I can learn something...and I do need some advice on a difficult problem. Let me show you this.
　　Grandpa: I don't want to give you a final opinion without studying these building plans more carefully. But a simple solution might be to move the air-conditioning units instead of redesigning the entire system. It might be simpler and less expensive.
　　Danny: You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm. Welcome aboard!
　　Grandpa: It all happened so quickly! I can't believe it!
　　Susan: I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful.
　　Grandpa: He was more than helpful. He actually took me to meet his foreman.
　　Susan: I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa.
　　Grandpa: I don't know how to thank you, Susan. You're a wonderful granddaughter.
　　Susan: It's good to see you so happy.
　　Grandpa: I'll be at the construction site tomorrow. What are you doing tomorrow night?
　　Susan: I'm not doing anything. Why?
　　Grandpa: How about a date with your grandfather? I owe you a good steak dinner.
　　Susan: I'll accept. Tomorrow night. You and me. Dinner. What time?
　　Grandpa: I'll pick you up here at seven. Is that OK?
　　Susan: I can't wait! And you can tell me all about your first full day back on the job.
　　Grandpa: It's a deal!
　　Episode 13 A Real Stewart
　　Act 1.
　　Ellen: There's nothing more joyous than the arrival of a new baby.
　　Susan: I am so excited, Mother! Just imagine-Marilyn and Richard must be thrilled! Oh, a new baby!
　　Ellen: Max...Max...Max. Oh, it's a sweet-sounding name for a sweet little boy. My first grandchild.
　　Susan: And my first nephew. Isn't he just adorable? He looks a lot like you, Mom. He does.
　　Ellen: Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like Richard, and I guess he looks a lot like me. Oh, he's got Richard's eyes, though.
　　Susan: I really want Harry and Michelle to see Max.
　　Ellen: When are they coming?
　　Susan: Tomorrow. Harry has an account to work on today. Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. Big blue eyes. The baby even looks at you like Richard does.
　　Ellen: Well, children usually referable their parents.
　　Susan: It's true Michelle is a lot like Harry in so many ways. And she's shy with new people, just like he is.
　　Ellen: You really like Michelle, don't you?
　　Susan: Yes. I'm very fond of her.
　　Ellen: And Harry, too?
　　Susan: Well...
　　Ellen: Uh, it's four-thirty. Oh, my! Marilyn and Richard will be home from the hospital any minute, and we must prepare this room.
　　Susan: Where will we put all the presents?
　　Ellen: Well, let's take everything to the living room. Marilyn and Richard and the baby need the space. It's crowded in here.
　　Grandpa: The welcome sign is up: "Welcome home, Max."
　　Ellen: Isn't it exciting, Grandpa?
　　Susan: Your first great-grandchild.
　　Grandpa: Yes. Yes, sir. A great-grandchild. A great-grandson. Another generation to carry on the Stewart name.
　　Susan: I love you, Grandpa. You make me feel so proud to be part of our family.
　　Grandpa: One day, You'll have your own family, and I'll be proud to be part of it.
　　Ellen: Now you understand my feelings, Susan. I'm Grandpa's daughter-in-law, but I feel like a Stewart. He's always made me feel like his own daughter.
　　Grandpa: Well, that's because you're so much like us-wonderful!
　　Susan: Mom, got it. This will make a nice gift for Marilyn and dates and information about Max's life here. Let's see. Name: Max Stewart. Does he have a middle name?
　　Ellen: No, just Max. I like that. No middle name. No middle initial.
　　Grandpa: Like me. I'm Malcolm Stewart. Just Malcolm Stewart.
　　Susan: And Max has your initials, Grandpa:M.S.
　　Ellen: Uh, it must mean something.
　　Susan: Weight: eight pounds six ounces.
　　Grandpa: Eight-six. Big boy! All the Stewart men were big.
　　Ellen: Well, Robbie was eight pounds two ounces, and Richard was eight pounds three.
　　Susan: And me?
　　Ellen: Eight pounds six. You were big, just like Max.
　　Susan: Eight pounds six, just like me. That's nice. Length. Length?
　　Ellen: Richard says Max is twenty-one inches long.
　　Grandpa: Tall. All the Stewart men are tall.
　　Ellen: Well, Grandpa, you're about five-nine or five-ten. I wouldn't call that tall.
　　Grandpa: I take after my mother's family. They were...they were... they were average.
　　Susan: Mother:Marily.Father:Richard. And lots of pages for Richard's photos of Max.
　　Grandpa: Speaking of mother and of father-and speaking of Max hear the car. They're here!
　　Ellen: Oh! Oh, quickly! Go, go, go!
　　Ellen: Let's see. Oh, welcome home. Oh, let her in. Wait with your pictures for a second. Come on, darlings. Sweetheart... Sit down right here.
　　Susan: Oh, he's so cute! Oh, Marilyn!
　　Robbie: Max looks just like Grandpa.
　　Grandpa: A real Stewart.
　　Marilyn: I'm so happy to be home with my family-and with Max.
　　Act 2.
　　Susan: It's almost ten 0'clock. I've got to go. Tomorrow is Monday, and work begins at eight in the morning for me. Oh, I'm so happy that Max is home. He's the sweetest little thing.
　　Ellen: I'll drive you to Grand Grandpa, Robbie, and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.
　　Richard: It's so good to have you home again...and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.
　　Marilyn: To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.
　　Richard: TLC-tender loving care. That's our motto.
　　Marilyn: Did you see the washcloth and the towels with the teddy bears on them? Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for max.
　　Richard: It was so kind of them. Now Max has come into everyone's life.
　　Marilyn: The house is so alive with him here. The welcome sign over the door. The boxes of presents. The M-Z-X over his bassinet. Robbie put that there. Susan's teddy bear. So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.
　　Richard: Oh, and Grandpa's baseball glove. You know, it hung over my crib, too. And it hung over Robbie's crib.
　　Marilyn: Part of Grandpa's magic?
　　Richard: Oh, that's not all. It hung over Susan's crib.
　　Marilyn: Part of Grandpa's magic?
　　Richard: Oh, that's not all. It hung over Susan's crib.
　　Marilyn: The same baseball glove?
　　Richard: That's right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck. He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team. He believes it'll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.
　　Marilyn: And then he takes it back when Max is ready to use it?
　　Richard: Yes, and replaces it with a new glove so the old one will be ready for a new member of the Stewart family
　　Marilyn: Grandpa really loves his family, doesn't he? So do I.
　　Richard: And so do I.
　　Richard: And so does Max.
　　Marilyn: After he eats!
　　Act 3.
　　Marilyn: Thanks, Michelle.
　　Michelle: I hope you like it.
　　Marilyn: Isn't this baby outfit adorable? With his name on it "Max." Thanks so much, Harry and Michelle.
　　Richard: We really appreciate it.
　　Harry: I'm glad you like it. Michelle Picked it out.
　　Michelle: Yes. I told Daddy to pick blue ones. Blue is for boys, and pink is for girls.
　　Grandpa: And Max is some boy.
　　Richard: He's a real Stewart.
　　Granpa: Right!
　　Ellen: That was so thoughtful of you, Michelle. Especially to pick it out in blue.
　　Susan: Would you like to see baby Max, Michelle?
　　Harry: Could she? Could we?
　　Michelle: Could I?
　　Marilyn: Take them upstairs, Susan. Harry and Michelle can watch Max sleeping.
　　Susan: Let's go.
　　Harry: Come on, Michelle. Before Max wakes up.
　　Marilyn: Will you please take this upstairs, Susan?
　　Susan: Uh-hum.
　　Marilyn: Thank you.
　　Philip: Michelle is very grown up for a ten-year-old, huh?
　　Ellen: She's smart and sensitive for her age.
　　Grandpa: Growing up without a mother is difficult. You mature quickly.
　　Ellen: Susan's like a mother to Michelle. They have a good relationship. Do you think Susan and Harry will get married?
　　Robbie: Yeah. You can count on it.
　　Philip: I think so. Yes. They get along so well.
　　Grandpa: I like him. He's good for Susan.
　　Ellen: He's a little quiet.
　　Richard: It's hard to do anything but listen in this family.
　　Ellen: How can anybody get a word in around here?
　　Marilyn: You're right, Ellen.
　　Philip: Oh, really?
　　Richard: It's the way it should be. The Stewarts are the Stewarts!
　　Grandpa: They always were, and they always will be.
　　Richard: Right!
　　Grandpa: They've always got an opinion. Always got something to say.
　　Marilyn: And now there's Max Stewart, and if he talks as loudly as he cries, we're all in for trouble.
　　Robbie: He's quiet now.
　　Marilyn: Mmm-hmm.That's because he's sleeping.
　　Harry: He's really cute.
　　Susan: It's not necessary to whisper, Harry. A baby gets used to voices.
　　Harry: I remember now. We always whispered when Michelle was born.
　　Michelle: And I didn't sleep well. Daddy told me. I never slept. And when I did, I woke up when I heard someone speak.
　　Susan: I bet you were cute.
　　Harry: She sure was.
　　Michelle: Not as cute as Max. He's like a little doll.
　　Michelle: Oh, good. Now I can help diaper him.
　　Susan: Let's get Marilyn. What do you do when he cries like that?
　　Harry: You pick him up.
　　Susan: He's so little...so new. Let's call Marilyn.
　　Marilyn: Time for a feeding and time for a diapering. You're a real Stewart.
　　Episode 14 Playing Games
　　Act 1.
　　Harry: You like living in New York, don't you?
　　Susan: Oh, I love it. It's so convenient. I can take the bus to work...or the subway...or a taxi. And there's so much to do. Lots of movie houses, and the theater.
　　Harry: I know what you mean. I'd like to live in the city, but living in New Jersey and the suburbs is better for Michelle. Trees, grass.
　　Susan: There's a lot of good things about suburban living. I grew up in Riverdale, Remember? So I know. But, as a working woman, I think New York has all the conveniences-including the best tomatoes.
　　Harry: The truth is, I'd like to live in the city. Michelle's the right age. There are lots of things for her here.
　　Susan: You're right, Harry. Today is the perfect example. Michelle and her friends are at the aquarium in Brooklyn. They come back here for lunch, then go uptown to the Museum of Natural History. There's so much for young people to see and do. It's just incredible!
　　Harry: Not just for young people. What about me? I've never been to the aquarium or Museum of Natural History. Have you?
　　Susan: Oh yes, Harry. My mother and father often took us somewhere in the city on the weekends. Dad was a busy doctor, but he usually managed to squeeze a Sunday in with Richard, Robbie, and me. I used to love to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
　　Harry: I've been there several times. Twice with Michelle.
　　Susan: You ought to think about spending more time with Michelle at all the great places in the city.
　　Harry: Well, perhaps, you'll help me select some of the great places. And perhaps, you'll join us?
　　Susan: Perhaps I will.
　　Susan: Well, there we are .All set for lunch, Harry.
　　Harry: It looks inviting. I wish Michelle and her friends would get here. I'm starving, aren't you?
　　Susan: I can't wait to take a bite of the pumpernickel. It smells so delicious. Coming! Coming! Who is it?
　　Michelle: Michelle. It's us, Susan.
　　Susan: Come in Michelle, and bring your friends along. We're on the fifth floor. Oh you're been here before
　　Harry: Susan, I really appreciate your doing this Michelle and her friends.
　　Susan: Oh, please, Harry. It's nothing. I'm not just doing it for Michelle. I'm doing it for you.
　　Harry: Thank you.
　　Susan: I'm doing it for us, Harry.
　　Harry: Well, it's...it's important for Michelle to see us together more often. That's true.
　　Susan: It's important for Michelle and me to get to know each other better. That's important for us.
　　Harry: That makes me feel good.
　　Susan: What, Harry? What makes you feel good?
　　Harry: Well, that you care about Michelle, that you care about me, and that you care about us.
　　Susan: Well, Harry, that's because I do. I do care.
　　Harry: They'll be here any minute .Susan, I'd like to continue this conversation later.
　　Susan: Of course, Harry. We'll finish the conversation when they go to the museum.
　　Harry: I'd like that.
　　Susan: So would I.
　　Act 2.
　　Michelle: Oh, Daddy! We had such a good time at the aquarium. I saw a real shark. I could almost touch it.
　　Harry: I'm so glad. Hi, Michelle, why don't you introduce everybody to Susan?
　　Michelle: Hi, Susan.
　　Susan: Hi.
　　Michelle: I'd like you to meet Audrey and her mother, Mrs. Cooper.
　　Susan: Hello, Audrey. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cooper. I'm Susan Stewart.
　　Michelle: And this is Shirley and Nicole.
　　Susan: Hi, girls.
　　Harry: Come on in. Come on in, Mrs. Cooper on in, everybody.
　　Mother: The aquarium was so exciting. I had never been there before. The girls learned a great deal. Frankly, so did I.
　　Susan: Well, please sit down and tell us all about it during lunch.
　　Harry: We prepared some tuna fish and cheese sandwiches for lunch.
　　Michelle: I love tuna fish. Don't you , Audrey?
　　Susan: I remember when I used to b a Girl Scout. My mother would take us everywhere, too.
　　Mother: Susan, I understand you're in the toy business.
　　Susan: Yes, I am. My company manufactures toys and games for children.
　　Harry: Susan's vice-president in charge of new toys and games.
　　Susan: And the marketing of new toys and games.
　　Michelle: Can we test a new game for you, Susan?
　　Susan: That's an excellent idea, Michelle. I happen to have a game which I brought home to study.
　　Michelle: Let us try it ! Don't you want to play? Nicole ? Shirley? Audrey?
　　Susan: We tested it last week on twelve-to fifteen-year-olds, and they found it to be too easy-in other words...boring. We think it might be just right for ten-to twelve-year- olds.
　　Michelle: That's us, Susan.
　　Susan: First, you shuffle the deck and lay them face down. Then you select the leader. I'll be the leader. The leader takes the first ten cards and lays them face up on this stand. h-t-e-r-c-z-e-p-e-s. Everyone gets a turn, going counterclockwise, left to right. You have thirty seconds to make a word, using as many letters as possible. You get one point for each letter, plus the person with the longest word gets ten extra point. The first one to get one hundred points wins.
　　Michelle: That's easy.
　　Susan: OK, let's go around the atble. You first, Audrey.
　　Audrey: Chest-c-h-e-s-t.
　　Susan: Good. That's five points also. It's your turn, Shirley.
　　Shirley: Creep-c-r-e-e-p.
　　Susan: Creep. That's another five-letter word. Five points. So far, you're all tied.
　　Harry: Sheet -s-h-e-e-t-sheet.
　　Susan: Sheet is a five-letter word. Michelle, your turn.
　　Michelle: Cheese-c-h-e-e-s-e.
　　Susan: Terrific! Michelle wins with a six-letter word, plus she gets an additional ten points for a total of sixteen points. How are you enjoying the game so far?
　　Michelle: I think it's too easy.
　　Susan: Too easy?
　　Harry: Michelle!
　　Susan: It's OK, Harry Michelle is quite right. She just said it's too easy.
　　Harry: Well, I like the game.
　　Mother: I enjoyed lunch, Susan. Thank you so much, but we have fo get going to meet the rest of the troop at two 0'clock at the museum.
　　Susan: Oh, it was nice meeting all of you. I hope you have a wonderful time at the Museum of Natural History.
　　Harry: Good-bye, everybody. Have a good time.
　　Girls: Bye.
　　Harry: See you in front of the museum at five 0'clock.
　　Mother: Oh, OK. Thanks, Mr. Bennett. That'll be fine. And thanks again for the lunch and for the game.
　　Michelle: Good-bye, Susan It's not a bad game. It's just... slow.
　　Susan: Just slow. You helped save our company a lot of money. Bye-bye.
　　Harry: You are wonderful with kids.
　　Susan: I am.
　　Harry: Isn't there a conversation that we have to finish?
　　Act 3.
　　Harry: There's a conversation we have to finish.
　　Susan: What was it about?
　　Harry: It was about caring.
　　Susan: Oh?
　　Harry: Yes, caring. I said that it makes me feel good that you care about Michelle.
　　Susan: Well, I do care about Michelle.
　　Harry: And it makes me feel good that you care about me.
　　Susan: You know I do. You're a...wonderful friend.
　　Harry: And it makes me feel good that you care about us.
　　Susan: Well...well, I do, Harry. It's only natural that if I care about Michelle and I care about you, then I care about us.
　　Harry: It's OK, Susan. We had this part of the conversation before Michelle and her friends arrived. Now comes the good part.
　　Susan: Like what?
　　Harry: Well, assume that if you care about Michelle and you care about me and you care abut us, that we can talk about us. I mean-you and me. Isn't that right?
　　Susan: What are you trying to say, Harry?
　　Harry: What I'm trying to say...since this is so easy ...Here are ten letters that express my feelings for you.
　　Susan: Don't be silly, Harry.
　　Harry: You want a hint? It's two words.
　　Susan: You're making the game harder.
　　Harry: Can't you figure it out? Seven letters... two words...that express the feeling that I feel for you in my heart.
　　Susan: Harry, I get it!
　　Harry: Well? Does that mean you'll marry me?
　　Susan: Is that a proposal, or are we just playing a game?
　　Harry: Sit down, Susan. There's something I have to ask you. Susan, will you marry me?
　　Susan: It's such an important decision .There's so many things to talk about. There are three things that have to be done first, Harry.
　　Harry: Three things?
　　Susan: First, we have to decide where to live.
　　Harry: Well, that's easy. We talked about that earlier. We'll live in New York.
　　Susan: All right. Second, we have to talk to Michelle together about being married.
　　Harry: We'll do that immediately. What' the third thing?
　　Susan: You have to ask for my father's permission.
　　Harry: Absolutely! But first things first. We have to go pick up Michelle.
　　Susan: Oh, I'm so happy, Harry!
　　Harry: Not as happy as I am.

　　Richard: Thank you. I don't believe this. Well, it isn't the Watermill Inn, but let's get a look at the view.
　　Marilyn: How is the view?
　　Richard: Great, if you enjoy looking at a parking lot.
　　Marilyn: Well, maybe we'll see the view in the morning. Right now, we should clean up this room.
　　Richard: Sorry, Marilyn.
　　Marilyn: Why should you be sorry?
　　Richard: Well, the rain, the room, the view of the parking lot. It isn't the way I hoped it would be.
　　Marilyn: Stop blaming yourself. After all, we're here, we're alone, we're together. And I l love you. Isn't that enough?
　　Richard: Is is for me, but I wanted this weekend to be special for you.
　　Marilyn: It is special. Happy anniversary.
　　Richard: It's still raining. I want to play tennis.
　　Marilyn: I want some breakfast. Let's call room service and order a mice breakfast, and then we'll figure out what to do today.
　　Richard: Right. Would you give me room service, please? I beg your pardon! Oh, I see. They don't have room service at Old Country Inn.
　　Marilyn: Well, let's go down to the coffee shop.
　　Richard: They don't have a coffee shop .We can get our meals at Mrs. Montefiore's down the road.
　　Marilyn: That's OK, honey. I love walking in the rain.
　　Richard: Oh, you're being a really good sport about this, Marilyn, but I think we should face the truth.
　　Marilyn: What's that?
　　Richard: This is not the way to spend our fifth anniversary.
　　Marilyn: Well, what do you want to do?
　　Richard: Why don't we get in the car and drive home?
　　Marilyn: Oh, Richard, it really isn't that bad.
　　Richard: Do you want to stick it out for the whole weekend?
　　Marilyn: Well, I'll admit the room is uncomfortable.
　　Richard: Uh-hum.
　　Marilyn: And I do feel bad about your mother having to take care of the baby all weekend.
　　Richard: Why don't we just check out?
　　Marilyn: OK.
　　Marilyn: Hello? Yes. Yes, this is she. Oh, hello! How nice of you to remember us! Yes, My husband did call. You do? Really? It won't be any trouble? Oh, yes, I think we'd like that very much. Fifteen minutes! Thank you. Good-bye. You will never guess.

　　Marilyn: Mrs. Montefiore from the Watermill Inn.
　　Richard: What is she calling about?
　　Marilyn: They have an opening. Someone just checked out, and Mrs. Montefiore has reserved the honeymoon suite for us.

　　Richard: It's fantastic! Oh, Now all it has to do is stop raining. Let's go.
　　Act 3.
　　Innkeeper: Welcome to the Watermill Inn.
　　Marilyn: Oh, Richard, it's exactly as it was when we were married!
　　Innkeeper: And when I got married.
　　Marilyn: Even the old patchwork quilt is the same!
　　Innkeeper: My great-grandmother made that quilt when Teddy Roosevelt was President. In those day, when they made quilts, they cut patches from the old clothing of every member in the family os that each one would be a part of it.

　　Richard: Homemade buttermilk biscuits.
　　Marilyn: Slices of orange with burnt honey.
　　Richard: Let's eat!
　　Marilyn: First I want to call home and check on your mother and the baby.

　　Marilyn: She doesn't know we've changed hotels.
　　Richard: You're right. Of course.
　　Marilyn: Hello, operator. I'd like to call Riverdale, New York.
　　Richard: This food is heavenly, isn't it?
　　Marilyn: This whole place is heavenly. Do you remember that old desk? Mrs. Montefiore told me that George Washington sat at that desk and wrote to his wife Martha.
　　Richard: What do you want to do after breakfast?
　　Marilyn: Why don't we take a walk down to the river?
　　Richard: In the rain?
　　Marilyn: No. Look out the window. The sun is shining!
　　Richard: Now this is my idea fo a good time!
　　Episode 16 Full of Surprise
　　Act 1.
　　Robbie: The mailman just dropped some mail in our box Grandpa.
　　Grandpa: Probably a lot of advertising and bills. Why don't you write to me, Robbie, so I can get some interesting mail?
　　Robbie: You were right, Grandpa. Advertising, bills, bills, advertising.
　　Grandpa: Yes. It's just like I said, Robbie. Nothing interesting.
　　Robbie: You won't believe it, Grandpa, but there's a letter here addressed to you, Mr.Malcolm Stewart, and it looks like a personal letter.
　　Grandpa: Oh, it must be a bill.
　　Robbie: I don't think so. The return name and address is Pete Waers, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.
　　Grandpa: You're joking. Pete Waters?
　　Robbie: Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton. You know him?
　　Grandpa: Do I know Pete Waters? You bet I do! He was my roommate in college. He visited with Grandma and me in Florida about five years ago.
　　Robbie: What does he say? Is he OK?
　　Grandpa: Yeah, he's fine. Just fine. He's writing to invite me to spend a weekend with him at his farm. He's planning a get-together with two or three other college friends. The dindof a fifty-year anniversary reunion.
　　Robbie: Sounds like fun. Fifty Years? Wow!
　　Grandpa: It sounds like fun to me, too, Robbie.
　　Robbie: What kind of farm does he have?
　　Grandpa: I've never been three, Robbie, but he has chickens and cows and all. That means fresh eggs and fresh milk.
　　Robbie: Does he have a family?
　　Granpa: No, he doesn't fobbie. He never married. He's not as lucky as I am to have a family and grandchildren . I'm a lucky man.
　　Robbie: How come he never got married?
　　Grandpa: That's a good question, Robbie. A very good question. He never married because the girl he was in love with in college married someone else. As simple as that. He never got over it.
　　Robbie: He must have loved her very much.
　　Grandpa: Yes. Very much. Lillian Winters. She was in our class.
　　Robbie: And what happened?
　　Grandpa: She was in love with Donald McGrath, the quarterback on our football team.
　　Robbie: Football players are always popular with the ladies.
　　Grandpa: She liked Pete, and they went to dances together. But her heart was with Donald.
　　Robbie: Did he ever get over it?
　　Grandpa: No, he never did.
　　Robbie: Where is she today?
　　Grandpa: I don't know. Maybe Lillian will be at the reunion.
　　Robbie: You think so?
　　Grandpa: Pete's full of surprises.
　　Robbie: I wish I could go there with you, Grandpa. What do you think the surprise will be?
　　Grandpa: With Pete, you never know, Robbie.
　　Robbie: Won't it be exciting to see all your college friends there again?
　　Grandpa: It is already. I'm kind of excited about going now. Next weekend...sleep over Friday and Saturday night and come back Sunday. I can't wait!
　　Ribbie: Don't you think you ought to call Pete and tell him you're coming?
　　Grandpa: You're reading my mind, Robbie.
　　Act 2.
　　Attendant: Hello. What can I do for you?
　　Grandpa: Hi. Fill'er up. I need a full tank.
　　Attendant: Check the hood?
　　Grandpa: No, thanks.
　　Attendant: Whereabouts are you headed?
　　Grandpa: Pete Waters's farm, near Chesterton.
　　Attendant: I know it well. Pete Waters' lived around here almost as long as I have.
　　Grandpa: How long is it going to take for me to get there?
　　Attendant: About fifteen minutes. There's a shortcut-is you know it.
　　Grandpa: No, I don't. Could you tell me how to use the shortcut?
　　Attendant: Sure. You take the next left turn. You'll see a stop sign. Make a right at the stop sign. Stay on that road, and you'll cross a blue bridge. Then you'll see a big old red bam. That's the back of Pete Waters's place.
　　Grandpa: That's quite a difference from the directions that Pete sent me.
　　Attendant: Now, if you take that route, it's probably a lot simpler, but it'll take you ten minutes longer.
　　Grandpa: OK. Let me repeat it. I take the next left turn to the stop sign. Then a right across a blue bridge, and then a big red barn.
　　Attendant: Can't miss it.
　　Grandpa: How much do I owe you?
　　Attendant: Well, that'll be eighteen dollars and seventy cent. No charge for the cleanup. It's on the house.
　　Grandpa: Well, here's a twenty.
　　Attendant: Ah. OK. That's a dollar and thirty cents change. Thee we go... will mae twenty. Thanks.

　　Grandpa: This must be Peteps barn.Turn right to the house. Hi.
　　Worker: Hi. What can I do for you?
　　Grandpa: Is this the Pete Waters farm?
　　Worker: It is.
　　Grandpa: I'm a friend of Pete's . I'm looking for the house.
　　Worker: It's just over yonder. Keep along this road till you get to the end of the fence. You'll see the chicken. His house is on the left.
　　Grandpa: Well, thanks.
　　Grandpa: "have gone to the railroad station. Back soon with a surprise. Make yourself at home. Have a look around Pete." Same old Pete Waters. Always full of surprises.

　　Amold: It's wonderful!
　　Pete: It's wonderful for me. Lillian will make me a happy man finally.
　　Grandpa: You are full of surprises, Pete.
　　Pete: We are going to spend the entire weekend having a good time together here on the farm. We are going to celebrate all weekend.
　　Peggy: When is the wedding?
　　Pete: That's another surprise. Lillian and I were married two weeks ago in Detroit. She's come here to stay.
　　Grandpa: Wait till I tell my family about this!
　　Peggy: Why, that's wonderful!
　　Episode 17 Photo Finish
　　Act 1.
　　Marilyn: What are you doing?
　　Richard: I think I've got them.
　　Marilyn: You think you've got what?
　　Richard: Performing arts-performing arts centers. I think I've got them all, but I'm not sure.
　　Marilyn: I think you have got it, Richard. Lincoln Center, home of the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet, the New York Philharmonic.
　　Richard: Shubert Alley, center of the theater on Broadway.
　　Marilyn: And Comegie Hall. And the others. I do have it all.
　　Marilyn: You have been working on this for some time, Richard. I'm glad you feel you've finally put it all together. What now?
　　Richard: Now for the hard part.
　　Marilyn: Oh, you think you're going to have a hard time getting the album published?
　　Richard: Well, it won't be easy.
　　Marilyn: So, what do you think you're going to do?
　　Richard: Does the name Harvey Carlson ring a bell?
　　Marilyn: Oh,yes! Harvey Carlson! I remember.
　　Richard: He said I should call him. He's the publisher of the Carlson Publishing Company. He said they need a new book of photographs, and he really liked my concept.
　　Marilyn: So, why don't you call him in the morning?
　　Richard: Do you think I have enough to show him?
　　Marilyn: I've been through every section with you, Richard. It's quite complete. And now that you're satisfied, with the performing arts section, I think you should show it to Mr.Carlson.
　　Richard: You're right. My Family Album, U.S.A. feels right. I'll call in the morning and set up an appointment to see him.
　　Marilyn: He's going to love your work. Come on. Let's get some sleep.
　　Richard: Is it too early to call Mr.Carlson?
　　Marilyn: Seven after nine? No. I'm sure he's in his office.
　　Richard: His number is five, five, five, seven, five, three, two. Five, five, five, seven, five three, two. Hello. Mr. Carlson, please.
　　Receptionist: Mr.Carlson is busy at the moment. May I help you?
　　Richard: I'd like to make an appointment with him.
　　Receptionist: And your name is...?
　　Richard: My name is Richard Stewart. He told me to call him about my project, Family Album, U.S.A.
　　Receptionist: Mr. Stewart, I just spoke to Mr.Carlson. He would like to see you. But the only time he's available this week is tomorrow morning at ten 0'clock.
　　Richard: Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good-bye. Well, it's done. Tomorrow morning at a publisher's office.
　　Marilyn: Oh, it's so exciting, isn't it, Richard?
　　Richard: Well, finally a publisher will see my work.
　　Act 2.
　　Receptionist: Good morning.
　　Richard: Good morning. My name is Richard Stewart. I'm here to see Mr.Carlson.
　　Receptionist: Please sit down, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Carlson will be with you shortly.
　　Richard: Thank you.
　　Receptionist: Excuse me, Mr. Carlson, but Richard Stewart is here for his ten 0'clock appointment with you. OK. Thank you. Like I said, he'll be with you shortly.
　　Richard: Thank you.
　　Receptionist: Yes, Mr.Carlson. Yes, sir. He's ready for you, Mr. Stewart.
　　Richard: Thank you. In there?
　　Receptionist: Yes. In there. Good luck.
　　Carlson: Come in, come in. This is a crazy morning. Hello, Richard.
　　Richard: Hello, Mr.Carlson.
　　Carlson: Sit down, sit down.
　　Richard: Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
　　Carlson: I hope you've brought your pictures along. I see that you have. Let's get right to it. We need a new coffee table book, and a book of photos about the United States still feels right. OK, let's take a look. Good. Very good. Family Album, U.S.A. It's an excellent title. If you had to describe the book in one sentence, how would you do it?
　　Richard: Well, I'd describe it as a book which is a ... a portrait of the United States-the places, the people-mostly the people. The things they do, the ways they live, the placesd they visit, and the landmarks. A photographic journey.
　　Carlson: These are wonderful-these photos in your pen arts section. Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center.
　　Richard: I'm glad you like them.
　　Carlson: I do, but...
　　Richard: But?
　　Carlson: There's something missing. You've got a good eye, Richard. You're a terrific photographer. But before I can publish your work. I need to meet with my marketing department, and you've got to do one more thing.
　　Richard: What's that, Mr. Carlson?
　　Carlson: In the section on culture, you've included performing arts centers, but you've left out street performance.The mimes. The musicians. The dancers-in the parks and on the streets. Richard, if you go out and photograph street performances in the city, you'll have it.
　　Richard: That is a great ieda.The performing arts centers and the street performances. I'll do it.
　　Carlson: If you do it, I'll publish your work.
　　Richard: Are you serious?
　　Carlson: I've never been more serious. When do you think you can return with street performances?
　　Richard: A couple of weeks.
　　Carlson: If they're as good as the rest of these pictures, it's a deal.
　　Richard: You won't be disappointed, Mr.Carlson. Thanks.
　　Carlson: Good-bye, Richard, and good luck. See you in two weeks.
　　Richard: Good-bye, Mr. Carlson. Thanks. So if you like the street-performance photos, you'll really publish Family Album, U.S.A.?
　　Carlson: When I way something, I mean it. Go to work. Goodbye.
　　Richard: Good-bye.
　　Act 3.
　　Richard: Two weeks. I said I could do it in two weeks, and I did it.
　　Marilyn: The pictures you've taken are fabulous, Richard. Mr. Carlson will love them.
　　Richard: Monday morning. I'm going to show him the photos on Monday morning. I can't wait!
　　Marilyn: I'm very proud of you. You really did a beautiful job. I know he will love the new photographs for your book.
　　Richard: Yeah. I really did do a good job, didn't I? Hey, you know? There's still some film left on this roll, and there's one person I haven't photographed in a long time.
　　Marilyn: Who?
　　Richard: You.
　　Marilyn: Richard! I haven't brushed my hair.
　　Richard: You look great!
　　Marilyn; It's not fait, Richard. I'm not even ready.
　　Richard: Oh, that's wonderful! That's wonderful!
　　Carlson: Wonderful!
　　Richard: Thanks.
　　Carlson: Fabulous!
　　Richard: Thanks!
　　Carlson: Terrific!
　　Richard: Thanks.
　　Carlson: They get better and better.
　　Richard: Thanks a lot.
　　Carlson: This is sensational!
　　Richard: Yeah. Thanks.
　　Carlson: What a job! Good work, Richard!
　　Richard: I'm so glad you like them so much.
　　Carlson: Like them? They represent your best work.
　　Richard: Really?
　　Carlson: Absolutely.
　　Richard: Well...what do you think? Do I have my book?
　　Carlson: You do. You do. There's a book here, I'll have a contract and an advance payment waiting for you first thing in the morning.
　　Richard: Thank you.
　　Carlson: And while you're here I would like to introduce you to your editor. And I want you to meet the people in the art department. I'll set up an appointment with the marketing
　　people.
　　Richard: When do you think we'll be through?
　　Carlson: In about half an hour. Why?
　　Richard: I can't wait to tell Marilyn!
　　Episode 18 Making Difference
　　Act 1.
　　Ellen: I don't believe it!
　　Philip: What's wrong?
　　Ellen: Carter Boswell!
　　Philip: Who's Carter Boswell?
　　Ellen: He's running for the school board. The election's next month.
　　Philip: What's wrong with wanting to be on the school board?
　　Ellen: Nothing. But he wants to cut the school budget!
　　Philip: Maybe it needs cutting.
　　Ellen: Cutting the budget is fine, but he wants to do it by cutting all the cultural programs. No music, no dance, no concert, no stage presentations.
　　Philip: Why does he want to do that?
　　Ellen: He says it's to save the taxpayers' money, and I think he believes that the taxpayers' will vote for him if he spends less on the cultural programs.
　　Philip: He's probably right. Lots of people want their taxes used for new books and a new paint job in the schoolrooms.
　　Ellen: Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more and keep the cultural programs for our kids.
　　Philip: Well, I'm not sure, Ellen. I hear it from my patients. Lots of people are tired of higher taxes.
　　Ellen: I know, but if Boswell wins he'll be an important decision maker on the school board, and he doesn't know anything about our children's education.
　　Philip: Who's running against him?
　　Ellen: Nobody. That's the problem.
　　Philip: Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell is going to win this seat on the board.
　　Ellen: Oh, not if I can stop him!
　　Philip: And how are you going to stop him?
　　Ellen: I don't know. Maybe I'll run against him.
　　Philip: Well, You've got my vote.
　　Ellen: I'm serious, Philip. Why shouldn't I run?
　　Robbie: Why shouldn't you run for what, Mom?
　　Philip: Your mother is thinking of running for the school board.
　　Robbie: Hey, that's terrific, Mom!
　　Richard: Against Carter Boswell? Great!
　　Ellen: Well, if I run for office, the voters will have a clear choice. I stand for everything Boswell doesn't.
　　Marilyn: I think a lot of people will vote for you against Boswell, Ellen. I'll vote for you.
　　Ellen: Will you help me if I do run?
　　Marilyn: Absolutely.
　　Ellen: The trouble is it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign.
　　Philip: I think you can make a difference, Ellen. And in a short campaign you wouldn't need as much money. You know something, Ellen? Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice? I'm with you. You can make a difference.
　　Maxwell: Come in.
　　Ellen: Mr. Maxwell?
　　Maxwell: Yes, Charles Maxwell.
　　Ellen: My name is Ellen Stewart.
　　Maxwell: Hello. Please, sit down. You asked to see me. What would you like to see me about?
　　Ellen: I'd like your help.
　　Maxwell: Well, I'm editor of the most influential newpaper in Riverdale. Actually, it's the only newspaper. A lot of people would like my help. Do you have a story?
　　Ellen: I'm planning to run for the school board.
　　Maxwell: Against Carter Boswell?
　　Ellen: Yes.
　　Maxwell: Well, that is news.
　　Ellen: Will you announce that I'm running?
　　Maxwell: Sure. But I need some information.
　　Ellen: Of course.
　　Maxwell: Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell, Mrs.Stewart?
　　Ellen: Because I care.
　　Maxwell: "Vote for Ellen Stewart.She cares." Not a bad slogan. But what do you care about?
　　Ellen: Well, I care about the children of our town. I don't want hem to grow up without cultural programs in our school.
　　Maxwell: Do you have a plan?
　　Ellen: I want our children to learn more than reading, writing, and airthmetic. I want to keep the after-school programs-the music, the concerts.
　　Maxwell: It's not a bad plan. But who's going to pay for all of this?
　　Ellen: We are. The citizens of Riverdale, of course. I plan to get help from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale.
　　Maxwell: That's fair enough. Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs.Stewart?
　　Ellen: You don't know me. I can't expect you to take my side a against Boswell. But I do nee some publicity so that the people of our town know that I'm running for office and that I car about our children.
　　Maxwell: Fair enough. I certainly can print the news. And you are now making news.
　　Act 2.
　　Grandpa: Here are the fliers, hot of the press!
　　Ellen: Looks good. Simple.
　　Marilyn: Right over there, Grandpa. You fold the fliers, Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.
　　Richard: We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.
　　Grandpa: Need another box?
　　Ellen: Good work, gang.
　　Mike: Hi, this is Mike Johnson. Can I speak with Mr. Or Mrs.Anderson? Thanks.
　　Robbie: Mr.Nelson. Hi. This is Robbie Stewart. Did you know my mother is running for the school board?
　　Jimmy: Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart. "She cares." Oh, see you at the polls.
　　Robbie: Certainly, I'll give her your best wishes, Mr.Nelson.
　　Mike: Hi, this is Mike Johnson. Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs.Burns? Thank you.
　　Ellen: We have done so much in such a short amount of time. I can't believe it! Wait till Philip come and sees our progress!
　　Robbie: Everyone saw story in the Riverdale newspaper.
　　Ellen: Mr. Maxwell was very kind to print my announcement.
　　Grandpa: It helps enormously. Everybody in riverdale reads his paper.
　　Richard: Your photo in it helped, too.
　　Ellen: Thanks to you, Richard, it's a good picture.
　　Philip: Well, hi, all.
　　Richard&Robbie: Hi, Dad.
　　Ellen: Hello, darling.
　　Philip: May I...may I help?
　　Marilyn: Licking envelopes.
　　Grandpa: I fold the fliers.
　　Richard: We stuff them.
　　Philip: And I lick the envelopes.
　　Robbie: Hey, everybody, Mrs.Greenberg is on the phone. She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now-doing a commercial.
　　Philip: What channel?
　　Robbie: Five.
　　Philip: Five?
　　Boswell: ...and if you ask what I care about, I'll tell you. I care about the school buildings in need of paint. I care about more lockers for the teachers. I care about new fixtures in the hallways-not music or dancing or entertainment. I care about the practical things. If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.
　　Ellen: A lot of people will agree with him.
　　Philip: I told you.
　　Robbie: Too bad kids can't vote. It's our school, but we can't vote.
　　Richard: There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom.
　　Marilyn: There are, Ellen. Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial.
　　Philip: You have to go on television, too.
　　Ellen: Boswell's a powerful speaker.
　　Philip: You can be, too. Your ideas are good ones.
　　Ellen: I don't know. I'm not sure I'm up to it.
　　Act 3.
　　Ellen: ...my slogan is "I care". I care about people, not things, Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care. How was it?
　　Richard: You were terrific!
　　Ellen: Can I see it?
　　Richard: Sure.
　　Ellen: Hello. My name is Ellen Stewart, and I'm running for the open seat on the school board. My slogan is "I care". What does the word care mean?...I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care.
　　Philip: I like it, but now what? How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale will see it and hear it?
　　Richard: Leave it to me.
　　Ellen: ...I mean that when I say "I care". I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care.
　　Marilyn: What happened?
　　Richard: Mom is now on television in every appliance store in Riverdale, except Hamlin's. He's a Boswell voter.
　　Philip: That's a brilliant idea, Richard!
　　Grandpa: You inherited your father's brains.
　　Philip: We got our brains from you, Day.
　　Richard: And guess what? I called channel five. Their TV news is going to cover it. "Housewife campaigns in appliance stores." And I'll bet some magazine will pick up the story, too.
　　Robbie: Mom, you're going to win! I know it!
　　Philip: Hold it, Robbie! Just cool down. I know we're getting some attention now, but in the end the voters will have to decide.
　　Grandpa: You're going to win. Trust me!
　　Reporter: In the hotly contested race for the one seat on the Riverdale School Board, Mrs.Ellen Stewart has taken an early lead.
　　Robbie: She's winning! Mom, you're winning!
　　Reporter: Now returning to other local news...Riverdale High School beat its rival Horace Mann in baseball today...
　　Ellen: It's too soon to know for certain.
　　Philip: You're ahead. That's better than being behind.
　　Reporter: More sports after this.
　　Ellen: It's not over yet. Let's just all calm down, and wait for the final results.
　　Grandpa: Ellen, why don't you go out to the backyard and get some fresh air?
　　Ellen: Thank you, Grandpa. I need some.
　　Ellen: What happened?
　　Philip: You came very close, Ellen.
　　Grandpa: You lost by only a hundred and twenty-one votes.
　　Ellen: I lost.
　　Richard: You tried, Mom.
　　Marilyn: You lost by a very small number of votes.
　　Robbie: Only one hundred and twenty-one votes! I'm sorry, Mom.
　　Ellen: There just wasn't enough time.
　　Philip: Look, you've made a very strong impressing on our community. You'll have another chance next election.
　　Philip: Hello. Oh, yes, yes, Mr.Maxwell.
　　Ellen: Hello Mr.Maxwell.
　　Maxwell: How are you? I just called to tell you that you are very impressive. You lost the election, but you won the attention of the residents of Riverdale, of Boswell, and of me.
　　Ellen: Well, thank you, Mr. Maxwell. I appreciate your kind words. I needed that.
　　Maxwell: I hear Boswell wants to appoint you to a special arts committee. I'm sending over a reporter in the morning to interview you.
　　Ellen: You are?
　　Maxwell: I'm going to do an article on "Ellen Stewart-she cares. "Maybe we'll all care now. Good-bye.
　　Ellen: Thank you-and good-bye.
　　Philip: What was that about?
　　Ellen: You were right, Philip. I did make a difference in town.
　　Robbie: And in this family.
　　Episode 19 I Do
　　Act 1.
　　Harry: It looks wrong.
　　Philip: Hmmm. It is wrong.
　　Richard: Are they always that difficult to make?
　　Philip: The truth is...yes. I'll try again.
　　Robbie: At this rate, the wedding will take place tomorrow.
　　Philip: Not to worry. OK.Here we go.
　　Harry: I'm worried, Philip. What if we can't tie the tie?
　　Richard: If we can't tie the tie, then there can't be a wedding.
　　Robbie: You'd better not make Harry any more nervous than he is. Don't worry.We'll figure a way.
　　Grandpa: How're you doing, fellas?
　　Harry: Not so good, Grandpa. We can't get this bow tie tied. Nobody knows how to do it.Do you?
　　Grandpa: No. I never could, either.
　　Philip: Well, you have your own tuxedo. How do you tie your bow tie?
　　Robbie: Yeah, Grandpa, I've seen you in it. You look great.How do you tie it?
　　Grandpa: I don't.
　　Richard: You don't?
　　Harry: What do you mean?
　　Grandpa: I never could tie one of those...things...bow ties. I have always worn a clip-on bow tie.
　　Harry: A clip-on?
　　Philip: Of course. Now I remember.
　　Grandpa: Yes, it's so easy. All you do is clip it around under your collar.
　　Richard: We all need one of those.
　　Robbie: The tuxedo rental store. Do you think they're open?
　　Philip: Should be. Sunday's their big day.
　　Richard: I'll call and find out.
　　Grandpa: Well, if they're not, I'll lend you mine, Harry. You're the only one who really needs to be wearing a tuxedo, anyway.
　　Harry: Thanks, Grandpa.
　　Philip: I'm the father of the bride. I'm supposed to be worried about my daughter, and here I am with the man that's marrying my daughter-worrying about him.
　　Grandpa: Poor Harry. I know the feeling. Wedding-day litters.
　　Robbie: Are they open?
　　Richard: We're in luck. They're open. And they have lots of clip-on bow ties.
　　Robbie: I'll bicycle down to the village and get them.
　　Harry: You'd better hurry, Robbie.
　　Grandpa: There's lots of time. A little over two hours.
　　Harry: In two hours and fifteen minutes I'll be married to Susan.
　　Philip: And be a true member of the Stewart family.
　　Grandpa: Oh, you're a lucky guy, Harry. Susan is one of the best women you'll ever find. She's just like her grandma.
　　Richard: Now, once you put the ring on Susan's finger, you are one of us, Harry. And don't ever forget it.
　　Harry: Ring? Ring? Oh my! What did I do with the rings? I put them in the pocket of my sports jacket.
　　Richard: No, I think you put them in your tuxedo jacket pocket. Remember?
　　Harry: Right. What did I do with the rings?
　　Philip: Didn't you give them to Richard? He's your best man. I remember. You gave them to Richard.
　　Richard: Oh, yeah. I remember now. You handed them to me. What did I do with them?
　　Harry: I hope they aren't lost.
　　Grandpa: Oh, don't worry, Harry. They have to be here.
　　Richard: I remember. I gave them to Robbie to hold so I wouldn't lose them.
　　Harry: Oh, I forget. What time is it?
　　Grandpa: It's still a little over two hours, Harry. Just relax.
　　Harry: What about the rings?
　　Richard: I'm sure Robbie has them.
　　Harry: No, NO, Robbie doesn't have them. He gave them to me to hold on to them because he didn't want the responsibility of holding them. I put them in my tuxedo-but in the lapel pocket. That's a relief. I was really worried.
　　Richard: I'll hold on to them for you. The best man always keeps the rings.
　　Harry: You're right. You're right. You hold on to them so there won't be problem later.
　　Philip: Well, now, I think we'd better get dressed, fellas.
　　Grandpa: All right!
　　Richard: Robbie will bring the ties back.
　　Harry: Hey, leaving me?
　　Grandpa: You'll be fine.
　　Philip: Try to take it easy. It'll all be over in two hours.
　　Harry: Over?
　　Grandpa: The wedding ceremony will be over. You'll be husband and wife.
　　Harry: I guess you're right. Two hours from now.Two hours from now.
　　Act2.
　　Marilyn: And now for...something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
　　Susan: OK. Let's see. Something borrowed. That's this dress. Borrowed from Marilyn.
　　Ellen: Something blue. My wristband. I wore it when I married your father.
　　Susan: Oh, Mother. I forgot you still had it. It's just so lovely.
　　Ellen: I bought it in an antique shop when I was about eighteen years old. I saved it for my wedding day.
　　Susan: And you saved it for me, didn't you, Mother?
　　Ellen: Yes, honey I did. Are we ever going to finish?
　　Ellen: All right. OK. Something borrowed.
　　Marilyn: The wedding dress. And something blue.
　　Susan: The wristband. Something old?
　　Ellen: Something old. Right. What's old?
　　Susan: Of course! Something old. I had planned to wear them.
　　Ellen: Grandma's pearls! Oh, Grandpa will be so pleased that you're wearing them. I'm sure he misses Grandma on a day like this.
　　Susan: Help me with them, Marilyn. I've never worn them before. I've been saving them for today.
　　Ellen: Saving them for today? Oh, you're a real Stewart! Marilyn: Oh, there you go. Lovely!
　　Ellen: Lovely!
　　Susan: Lovely!
　　Marilyn: Something borrowed, something blue. Something old... and now for something new.
　　Susan: The veil. Oh, it's so beautiful, Marilyn!
　　Ellen: You really are a fabulous designer, Marilyn.
　　Marilyn: Doesn't it look jst right on Susan?
　　Ellen: Perfect!
　　Marilyn: And when you both say, "I do," Harry will lift this veil over your head and kiss the bride.
　　Ellen: Oh, I'm so excited!
　　Susan: When you said, "I do, " Marilyn, it suddenly became real.
　　Marilyn: That's all right, Susan. You've got the wedding-day jitters! In less than two hours, you will be Mrs.Harry Bennett.
　　Ellen: Oh, that reminds me. If we don't get dressed, we won't be there to see Susan become Mrs. Harry Bennett.
　　Susan: Before you leave-do I look all right?
　　Ellen: You never looked better.
　　Susan: Mom.
　　Marilyn: She's right. And that's dear little Max. Got to go and feed him.
　　Susan: What am I Supposed to do?
　　Marilyn: Take off the veil, kick off your shoes, and sit down.
　　Ellen: We'll come upstairs and get you in a little while.
　　Marilyn: Richard's going to take some wedding pictures before the ceremony. So just relax.
　　Susan: Are you kidding? Relax?
　　Susan: Susan Stewart...you are about to become Susan Bennett-Mrs. Harry Bennett.
　　Act 3.
　　Judge: Philip...Ellen.
　　Philip: Ah, Judge.
　　Judge: How are you? How are you?
　　Ellen: Hello.
　　Judge: I think it's time for the wedding to begin.
　　Judge: All right, ladies and gentlemen. Please take your places. The wedding ceremony is about to begin.
　　Judge: OK, Jane. Start the music.
　　Judge: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Do either of you have any reason why you should not legally be joined in marriage? Is there anyone present who can show any just cause why these two people should not be legally joined in marriage? Then, Harry Bennett, do you take Susan Stewart to be your lawful, wedded wife?
　　Harry: I do.
　　Judge: And you, Susan Stewart, do you take Harry Bennett to be your lawful, wedded husband?
　　Susan: I do
　　Judge: The rings, please.
　　Richard: I have them, Harry.
　　Judge: By the power vested in me by the laws of the State of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride now, Harry.
　　Episode 20 Quality Time
　　Act 1.
　　Robbie: Where's Mom?
　　Grandpa: She went to a school-board meeting.
　　Robbie: I don't know how she does it. She sure keeps busy.
　　Grandpa: It's import to her.There are lots of places to go, lots of things to do. She can't sit around and do nothings to do. She can't sit around and do nothing. Philip works late.
　　Robbie: I guess you're right. I wish I had her energy.
　　Philip: Anybody home?
　　Robbie: We're in here, Dad.
　　Philip: Oh. Hi, gang.
　　Grandpa: Hello, Philip. How was your day?
　　Philip: My day was just fine. So was my night. It's almost ten 0'clock. Mmm.I'm starving. Um...where's Mom?
　　Robbie: She went to a school-board meeting.
　　Grandpa: There's a note for you on the refrigerator.
　　Philip: Oh?
　　Philip: Did you have dinner, Robbie?
　　Robbie: Yeah. Mike and I had a hamburger at the diner. I came home a little while ago. You've been working late almost every night this week, Dad. Aren't you exhausted?
　　Philip: I don't have time to be exhausted.
　　Robbie: You and Mom haven't had dinner together with us in almost a full week.
　　Philip: Yeah, I feel bad about us not having dinner with the family, but our schedules are so different. Either I'm at the hospital doing paperwork, or Mom is at a committee meeting. I frankly don't know what to do about it.
　　Robbie: I'm worried about you and Mom. You really have been working too hard.
　　Philip: Well, I think I've had enough of that sandwich.
　　Robbie: You didn't finish it.
　　Philip: It's not good to eat before going to bed. A cookie can't hurt, though.
　　Philip: Well, I'm heading off for bed and a good night's sleep.
　　Robbie: Well, good night.
　　Philip: Good night, son. Good night, Dad. I'm going to bed.
　　Grandpa: Good night, Philip.
　　Philip: Haven't you finished balancing that checkbook?
　　Grandpa: I found another mistake. I'll be off to bed myself in a minute.
　　Philip: OK.Good night.
　　Robbie: I'm really concerned about them, Grandpa.
　　Grandpa: Concerned about whom?
　　Robbie: About Mom and Dad. They hardly ever see each other. Dad often works late, and Mom has all these committees she's on.
　　Grandpa: What do you propose to do about it? You have that look in your eye.
　　Robbie: I don't know, but there must be a way of getting them to spend more time together. Quality time.
　　Act 2.
　　Ellen: Hello there, Robbie. What are you doing up this late?
　　Robbie: Reading.
　　Ellen: Reading? At this hour? Ah, come on, Robbie. What are you doing up this late?
　　Robbie: Things on my mind.
　　Ellen: Do you care to talk about them?
　　Robbie: Sure, if you don't mind listening.
　　Ellen: Robbie, Robbie, remember me? I'm your mother. If you have something you want to talk about, I'm always prepared to listen.
　　Robbie: You haven't been around much lately.
　　Ellen: So that's it. OK, let's talk.
　　Robbie: You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night. Dad works hard, and he works late. You work hard on all your committees, and you work late.
　　Ellen: I thought you were proud of the work I do.
　　Robbie: I am, Mom. Real proud. You are one fantastic mom, but...but I've been noticing how little quality time you spend with Dad and me... and the family.
　　Ellen: It's a real problem, Robbie. I know it.
　　Robbie: I'm concerned. There must be a way that Day and you can spend more time together.
　　Ellen: Well, we always talk about taking a vacation together with the family.
　　Robbie: I think you ought to take a vacation away from the family-alone. Kind of a second honeymoon.
　　Ellen: It would be wonderful, but our schedules won't allow it.
　　Robbie: I think I have an idea.
　　Ellen: You do?
　　Robbie: Yup. I think I have an idea that will bring Dad and you together in a more scheduled way.
　　Ellen: What is it?
　　Robbie: Well, you know how Dad is always talking about the kids in the ward and how important it is for them to be paid attention to?
　　Ellen: Yes.
　　Robbie: Well...and how hard it i because the doctors and murses are so busy?
　　Ellen: Yes.
　　Robbie: Well, how would it be if you took some time to work with Dad towards solving that problem?
　　Ellen: I don't get it.
　　Robbie: Like setting up a regular weekly reading program. You and Dad. You and Dr.Philip Stewart-going to the children's ward once or twice a week and reading to them.
　　Ellen: Not bad. Not a bad idea, Robbie. As a matter of fact, it fits right in with something I'm working on right now with the school-board committee.
　　Robbie: What's that?
　　Ellen: I've been trying to work out a program in the public school that will bring parents and teachers together once a week to read to the students-their own children, really. By doing that, it will encourage reading.
　　Robbie: So it might fit in with a program for reading to the kids in the hospital.
　　Ellen: You're right. We'll do it! I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now.
　　Robbie: But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work. Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow?
　　Ellen: You are a very smart young man, Robbie. I think I'll wait until tomorrow.
　　Robbie: You won't forget, will you?
　　Ellen: Believe me, I won't. It is a great idea, and I promise you I won't forget.
　　Robbie: Thanks, Mom.
　　Ellen: Thank you, Robbie.
　　Act 3.
　　Ellen: Good morning. What a wonderful morning! Don't the flowers smell wonderful?
　　Philip: Good morning, Ellen. Yes, they do. That's why I'm reading my paper and having my coffee on the patio this morning. Ah, it does smell sweet. How was your school- board meeting last night? You must've come home very late.
　　Ellen: Did you find the sandwich I made for you?
　　Philip: Thanks, dear. I was so tired I didn't even finish it.
　　Ellen: Philip, I've been working on this special project with the school board, and I'd like your opinion about it.
　　Philip: What is it?Ellen: I've been trying to find a way to encourage reading.
　　Philip: Good luck!
　　Ellen: Well, I think I may have found a way to do it.
　　Philip: Tell me about it. I work with families every day, Ellen. I see how people spend their leisure time-young and old.
　　Ellen: Mostly watching television. Well, that would be OK if , and I repeat, if people took the time to read.
　　Philip: I couldn't agree with you more.
　　Ellen: The question is, how do we get them to read more?
　　Philip: I think you're going to give me the answer to tha question. You have that looking your eye.
　　Ellen: I do have an answer, Philip. Or at least I think I do.
　　Philip: Well, tell me about it.
　　Ellen: The plan is a simple one. Involve the entire family in a reading project.
　　Philip: In the home?
　　Ellen: Yes, in the home. But first in the school-rooms.
　　Philip: Hmm, interesting. But how do you plan to do that?
　　Ellen: By arranging with the public schools to schedule one hour a week-to start with. During that time parents are invited to attend-and to read along with the children- their children.
　　Philip: It can go beyond the school system, Ellen.
　　Ellen: Really?
　　Philip: I guarantee you it would go very in the hospitals. My patients-mostly kids-would love to read and be read to.
　　Ellen: You think so?
　　Philip: I know so.
　　Ellen: May be we can experiment with your patients and see how the plan works.
　　Philip: I love the idea. Would you work with me?
　　Ellen: I would love to, Philip.
　　Philip: And that way, we'll spend more time together, Ellen. We just don't see each other anymore.
　　Ellen: You and I are very busy these days. This is true. We need to find time to be together more, to do things together more-you and I. This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that.
　　Philip: I have a question.
　　Ellen: Yes?
　　Philip: What do we read?
　　Ellen: To the patients in the ward?
　　Philip: Yes.
　　Ellen: Well, let you and I talk about it. What would you like to read to them?
　　Philip: Mrs. Stewart and I will read a poem by Robert Frost.
　　Ellen: It's called "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening."
　　Philip: Would you begin, Ellen?
　　Ellen: All right. "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"by Robert Frost.
　　Whose woods these are I think I know.
　　His house is in the village though;
　　He will not see me stopping here
　　To watch his woods fill up with snow.
　　Philip: My little horse must think it queer.
　　To stop without a farmhouse near
　　Between the woods and frozen lake.
　　The darkest evening of the year.
　　Ellen: He gives his harness bells a shake
　　To ask if there is some mistake.
　　The only other sound's the sweep
　　Of easy wind and downy flake.
　　Ellen&Philip: The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
　　But I have promises to keep,
　　And miles to go before I sleep,
　　And miles to go before I sleep.
　　Grandpa: You two belong on stage! That was wonderful!
　　Ellen: Grandpa!
　　Philip: Dad...Robbie. When did you come?
　　Grandpa: We've been listening to you both. These are lucky kids.
　　Robbie: Do you enjoy reading together?
　　Philip: Well, we may read together aloud at home.
　　Grandpa: You were right, Robbie.
　　Robbie: I know.
　　Episode 21 A Big Fish in a Little Pond
　　Act 1.
　　Michelle: I really like this one Susan. Do you?
　　Susan: Turn around, Michelle. Let me see the back of it. I like it a lot. It fits well. It doesn't need any alterations. We must've bought the right size.
　　Harry: I like the color. She looks good in blue.
　　Michelle: I like blue, too, Daddy.
　　Susan: Try on the skirt and blouse outfit, Michelle-the one that Daddy wanted you to wear.
　　Michelle: OK.
　　Harry: Michelle has been a different kid since we've been married. She's never been happier.
　　Susan: And I've never been happier, Harry. I love her very much.She's been a joy.
　　Harry: We're very lucky, the three of us...and becoming part of the Stewart family, too.
　　Susan: We couldn't ask for anything more, could we?
　　Harry: Well...
　　Susan: Well...? Could we ask for anything more?
　　Harry: Well...we...
　　Michelle: How do you like it, Daddy?
　　Harry: It's my favorite outfit.
　　Susan: It's good for every day. It will be good for school, Michelle.
　　Michelle: I like it, too. I always like skirts that go like this. Do you want to see the winter jacket on me, Susan?
　　Susan: Yes, I do. Change back into your jeans, and put on the new winter jacket we bought today.
　　Michelle: OK.
　　Susan: What did you mean by"well...?" You had something on your mind when I said we couldn't ask for anything more.
　　Michelle: Is everything all right?
　　Harry: Everything is fine, Michelle.
　　Susan: Let's take a look at the winter jacket. Come on over here, Honey.
　　Michelle: It's kind of warm.
　　Susan: It is. That's why we bought it for you. This will be a perfect jacket for the wintertime when it's very cold out. But it's kind of small also. We must've bought the wrong
　　size.
　　Harry: Looks like we should've bought a bigger one. I guess we'll have to exchange it, too. I'm sure the store has others.
　　Michelle: I look silly! It is too small!
　　Susan: You're growing so fast, Michelle.
　　Michelle: Can I take it off? I'm hot!
　　Susan: Sure. Put it back in your room, and we'll hang everything up later.
　　Susan: Well, are you going to tell me what's on you mind, Harry?
　　Harry: I have been offered a job with a major accounting company in Los Angeles. I have been offered a job with a major accounting company in Los Angeles.
　　Susan: Los Angeles? That's a big decision.
　　Harry: I know. It will also affect you and your job, if we decide to go.
　　Susan: Wow! It sure will. But first tell me about the job, Harry. If it's a good one, then we'll make it work for us.
　　Harry: I have a client in the garment business, on Seventh Avenue. I do his taxes every year. He has a big sales office in Los Angeles, and the company in Los Angeles that does his major accounting work is looking for an executive. And he recommended me.
　　Susan: That's wonderful, Harry.
　　Harry: Yes, but it would mean that we'd have to move to L.A.
　　Susan: What about the salary?
　　Harry: The real discussion comes tomorrow. Susan, I don't plan to make any decisons until I have a chance to talk with you about it.
　　Susan: I understand, Harry.
　　Harry: And I don't have to make a quick decision. They know that I'm married and that I have a family.
　　Susan: Well, there's a lot think about. If it's a good job, then I've got to do some thinking about my career opportunities in Los Angeles.
　　Michelle: Is everything OK?
　　Susan: Yes, honey.
　　Act 2.
　　Grandpa: Hello. Hello there. Are you ready for lunch with your grandpa?
　　Susan: Oh! Hi, Grandpa. Yes, of course, I am, but my mind isn't.
　　Grandpa: What's the matter, Susan?
　　Susan: A real dilemma.
　　Grandpa: Does it have anything to do with you and Harry?
　　Susan: Yes, but I don't know where to start.
　　Grandpa: Maybe I can help. Tell me what it is, Susan.
　　Susan: Thanks, Grandpa. Please sit down, Oh! Harry has been offered a job in Los Angeles.
　　Grandpa: Well, this something to think about.
　　Susan: There are so many things to consider. There's Michelle. I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her. And my job. I don't know if I can get a good job in Los Angeles. And what about our family?
　　Grandpa: Can I tell you what I think?
　　Susan: Tell me.
　　Grandpa: I think that you're very successful and that you have a fantastic reputation in the toy industry. I think you could talk to Mr. Marchetta, and I think he could help you find a real good job in Los Angeles. He was very helpful to me, remember?
　　Susan: I suppose I could call him. But I'm not so sure that I want to leave New York, you, and the rest of our family.
　　Grandpa: Well, I'm not going to kid you, Susan. You know we'd all miss you. But this should be your decision. It's something that only you and Harry can work out.
　　Susan: If moving to L.A.is in Harry's best interest, I have to do what I can do to support him.
　　Grandpa: In every marriage, sacrifices have to be made by one partner from time to time.
　　Susan: And what about Michelle?
　　Grandpa: Well, What do you think?
　　Susan: I think Michelle is better off staying where she is.
　　Grandpa: What does she think?
　　Susan: I don't know for sure.
　　Grandpa: Well, you'll have to ask her.
　　Susan: I think I'm going to have a talk with Mr. Marchetta and get his feelings about my leaving. And about helping me find a job in Los Angeles.
　　Grandpa: Good idea.
　　Susan: I'll call him right now. No point in delaying. Thanks.Grandpa.
　　Bill: Harry, it's the perfect job for you. You'll love it.
　　Harry: It's a big decision for me, Bill. And I have to discuss it with my wife. I don't know if it's right for her.
　　BIll: She'll love it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime offer, Harry.
　　Harry: OK. Tell it to me again.
　　BIll: The company is Craft and Craft, the biggest accounting company in the country.
　　Harry: I know the company well. It's big.
　　Bill: The biggest.
　　Harry: Yeah, yeah. The biggest. When do I have to let you know?
　　Bill: Talk it over. Think it over. Let me know by the end of the week.
　　Harry: When would we have to move?
　　Bill: As soon as possible.
　　Harry: I also have my daughter to consider. I don't want to interrupt her school year.
　　Bill: Let me know by the end of the week. It's a great opportunity for you, Harry. Believe me.
　　Harry: I know.
　　BIll: Craft and Craft is the biggest in the country.
　　Harry: Yeah, I know. The biggest.
　　Susan: I think Michelle is asleep now. Let's talk.
　　Harry: I met with Bill York today.
　　Susan: And I talked with Mr. Marchetta. Did York make the offer?
　　Harry: Yup. He asked me if I want the job.
　　Susan: That's exciting, Harry. What was it?
　　Harry: A vice-presidency with the biggest accounting company in th country-Craft and Craft.
　　Susan: Aren't you excited about that?
　　Harry: Sure I am. But there's so much more to consider.
　　Susan: I talked to Mr. Marchtta.
　　Harry: What did he say? Did you tell him about me?
　　Susan: Of course, Harry. I want what's best for you, and I think I can get a good job through Mr. Marchetta inoios Amgeles also.
　　Harry: You're kidding.
　　Susan: No, I'm not kidding. I talked with him, and he understands completely. He has a major toy buyer in Los Angeles, and he's pretty sure that I can get a good job there.
　　Harry: Unbelievable!
　　Susan: But I think we should talk to Michelle about all of this.
　　Harry: You're right. We'll talk to her about it.
　　Susan: And how do you feel about taking the job in Los Angeles?
　　Harry: How should I feel? It's the biggest company in the country.
　　Susan: Well, then you feel good about taking it?
　　Harry: Well... I feel fine about it. Why shouldn't I?
　　Act 3.
　　Michelle: I love my school. I have so many good friends there now. I wouldn't miss a day even if I were really sick.
　　Susan: Come and sit down for a minute, Michelle. I'd like to talk to you about something. Something important.
　　Michelle: What's wrong, Susan?
　　Susan: Oh, there's nothing wrong, Michelle. But your dady and I are talking about something that I'd like your opinion about.
　　Michelle: I know. I heard you talking about it the other night when I was trying on my new clothes. It's about moving to Los Angeles.
　　Susan: You're right. How do you feel about it?
　　Michelle: Well, I really wouldn't want to move, but...
　　Susan: But?
　　Michelle: But if you and Daddy wanted to, I guess you know what's best for the family and for me.
　　Susan: That's very considerate of you, Michelle. But what about your friends?
　　Michelle: I'd miss them a lot, but I know what it feels like to miss someone.
　　Susan: Honey, we don't have to move if you're no going to be happy about it.
　　Michelle: Does Daddy want to move?
　　Susan: I think so. He's going to tell us tonight about the job offer.
　　Harry: Well, how was everybody's day today?
　　Susan: Michelle was chosen to do the school poster for the play this year.
　　Harry: Congratulations, Michelle! That's something! And how was your day, Susan?
　　Susan: I see you're in a good mood. Why don't you tell us about your day.
　　Harry: I met with Bill York.
　　Susan: It's OK to talk about it, Harry. Michelle knows all about it.
　　Harry: Really?
　　Susan: Really, Harry. Michelle and I have all kinds of feelings about leaving New York, the family, and friends. But is you think you should take the job, we're behind you.
　　Harry: What about Michelle's school?
　　Susan: We'll move after the school term.
　　Harry: What about her new friends?
　　Michelle: I'll make new friends wherever we are as lon as we're together.
　　Susan: We're a family, Harry. Whatever you think is right for you is right for us.
　　Harry: I am so touched. The two of you are really something.
　　Michelle: We love you, Daddy.
　　Harry: And I love you.
　　Susan: OK. Now, tell us about your talk with Mr. York. Did you take the job?
　　Harry: Nope.
　　Michelle: What?
　　Susan: No? You didn't take it?
　　Harry: No, I did not take the job.
　　Michelle: But, Daddy, I thought...
　　Susan: Harry, you didn't turn it down because of me...
　　Michelle: Or me?
　　Harry: No, no. I turned it down because of me.
　　Susan: How's that?
　　Harry: Well, I began to think about you and about Michelle, and then I asked myself, do I really want to work for the biggest company in the country?
　　Susan: And?
　　Harry: And I don't. I went into business for myself because I like being my own boss. I run my own company. I'm a big fish in a little pond. I'm not really sure I want to be a little fish in a big pond.
　　Michelle: Oh, Daddy, does that mean we don't have to move?
　　Harry: That's right, sweetheart.
　　Susan: Are you sure?
　　Harry: I couldn't be more sure, Susan.
　　Susan: I'm glad if you are, Harry.
　　Harry: And besides, how could I live in Los Angeles when all my favorite people live here?
　　Susan: Your favorite people?
　　Michelle: Who's that?
　　Harry: The Stewart family, of course.
　　Episode 22 Career Choices
　　Act 1.
　　Marilyn: "Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree top, When the wind blows. The cradle will rock. When the bough breaks, The cradle will fall, And down will come baby, Cradle and all."
　　Richard: Hi, Marilyn. What are you doing?
　　Marilyn: Just sketching. I've been thinking a lot about our responsibilities in the past few weeks.
　　Richard: I never stop thinking about them.
　　Marilyn: I've been wrestling with question of whether I go back to work or not.
　　Richard: I see.
　　Marilyn: And I'm torn. I really want to go back to work, use my talents, and pursue my career in fashion design like we as a fulltime mother, especially when he's a baby.
　　Richard: I really understand, Marilyn, But you never have to worry about Max. There's Mother and Grandpa...and I can always arrange my photo schedule around your schedule, if that will help.
　　Marilyn: It's not the same, Richard.
　　Richard: Have you discussed going back to work with your boss?
　　Marilyn: Rita Mae called yesterday.
　　Richard: Ah! That's what's got you thinking, isn't it?
　　Marilyn: She wants to know when I think I'll be returning to the boutique.
　　Richard: And you said...?
　　Marilyn: I said I'd give her an answer in a few days...that I wasn't sure.
　　Richard: I'm sure Rita Mae will understand and wait until you're ready to go back to work.
　　Marilyn: Well, maybe she will, and maybe she won't. Who knows? If I don't accept her offer, maybe she'll find someone else in the meantime, and when I'm ready to go back, there won't be a job for me.
　　Richard: That's something to consider. You've got yourself to think about, too.
　　Marilyn: But I am thinking about myself. Don't you see?
　　Richard: What do you mean?
　　Marilyn: It's not just the job. It's also my career as Max's mother. That's the way I look at it. I have two career opportunities at the same time. My career as a fashion Designer and my career as a mother.
　　Richard: I never really thought about being a mother as a career. I guess you do have two career opportunities and a decision to make.
　　Marilyn: I hear Max.
　　Richard: I'll go to him.
　　Marilyn: No, that's OK. I'll do it.
　　Act 2.
　　Ellen: There's your teddy bear, Max.
　　Ellen: He just loves that teddy bear that Grandpa Philip bought for him.
　　Marilyn: I took him to Philip's office yesterday for a checkup. You should have seen the look on his face when Molly gave him the injection.
　　Ellen: Oh, did he cry?
　　Marilyn: No, My dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say, "Mama, what are they doing to me? Help!"
　　Ellen: How did you feel? Tell the truth didn't you feel terrible?
　　Marilyn: I sure did. I held him closely. I kissed the top of his dear little head. He looked up at me. He tried to smile. Being with him helped.
　　Ellen: Helped him? Or helped you?
　　Marilyn: Being a mother is not easy, if that's what you mean.
　　Ellen: Speaking of being a mother, I've been meaning to ask you what you were thinking about regarding going back to work. I know Rita Mae called. I can imagine what is going through your head.
　　Marilyn: I'm sure you can, Ellen.
　　Ellen: There are so many things to consider. One thing that makes it easier for you is that you have us. Max will always have a family member to watch over him while you're at work. I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born.
　　Marilyn: What did you do?
　　Ellen: I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher. We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan, and I continued with my career.
　　Marilyn: Do you think you made the right decision?
　　Ellen: I think I did. But when Robbie was born, I decided to give fulltime attention to raising Robbie. I felt differently at that time.
　　Marilyn: And you gave up your career as a music teacher?
　　Ellen: Not exactly. I continued to teach piano lessons at home.
　　Marilyn: How did you feel about being away when Susan and Richard were babies?
　　Ellen: I think I did the right thing for them and for myself and for Philip. We needed the money. Remember?
　　Marilyn: Well, we do too, Ellen. Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house we want and need.
　　Susan: I can't wait till he's just a little older. Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids.
　　Marilyn: Max thanks you. I thank you. And Ricard thanks you. Now may I please say hello?
　　Susan: Hello. Hello. I miss Max and think about him all week long. We talk about him at dinnertime.
　　Ellen: Will you please try to relax? I've never seen you so wound up.
　　Marilyn: You seem to be enjoying the pressure.
　　Susan: The truth is, I am. My job is not an easy one, but I really enjoy it.
　　Marilyn: That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan.
　　Susan: What's the problem?
　　Ellen: Marilyn's career.
　　Marilyn: Well, my choice of careers.
　　Susan: Choice?
　　Marilyn: My career as a fashion designer versus my career as a mother.
　　Susan: Why does it have to be one or the other?
　　Ellen: That's what I said.
　　Marilyn: How's that?
　　Susan: Why can't you do both?
　　Ellen: She's right.
　　Marilyn: Both?
　　Susan: Well, that's what I do. I have a job, and I have Michelle. I take care of both to the best of my ability. It's not easy, but what is?
　　Ellen: And that's what I did. I did both with Richard and Susan, and I did both with Robbie.
　　Marilyn: I thought you stayed home with Robbie?
　　Ellen: I did. But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher which I could continue at home.
　　Susan: Why can't you work at home, Marilyn? You're very talented. Designing dresses is a career you could establish out of your home, couldn't you?
　　Marilyn: I don't know why I didn't think of it. It seems so simple now.for a year or two I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs.
　　Ellen: And you could make your dresses at home.
　　Susan: Sounds like a great way to solve the problem.
　　Ellen: That could solve your problem, Marilyn.
　　Marilyn: I'm going to call rita Mae at home and ask her come by and talk about it. She want to see Max, anyway.
　　Susan: I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn. You can do it.Do your designs at home-here.
　　Marilyn: And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique.
　　Ellen: And you can both benefit financially.
　　Marilyn: I'm going to call Rita Mae right now. Oh, Susan, thank you so much for coming all this way form the city to talk to me about it. I hope you don't mind having taken so much time away from your busy schedule.
　　Susan: Are you kidding? I don't mind at all. As a matter of fact, I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew.
　　Ellen: I think you should call Rita Mae right now. I think your idea of working at home is perfect.
　　Marilyn: I don't know what I would do without you. I'm lucky to have you all.
　　Ellen: We are lucky to have you, Marilyn.
　　Susan: And so is Max.
　　Act 3.
　　Ellen: Hi, big guy.
　　Marilyn: That must be Rita Mae.
　　Ellen: She sure got here quickly. That's a good sign. She must like you and your work, Marilyn.
　　Marilyn: I think she's just anxious to see Max. She loves children.
　　Rita Mae: Hi, Marilyn.
　　Marilyn: Welcome. It's so nice of you to come.
　　Rita Mae: Oh, I just wanted to see your baby, Max.
　　Ellen: Hello, Rita Mae.
　　Rita Mae: I haven't seen you since the hospital.
　　Ellen: I'm Ellen Stewart, Marilyn's mother-in-law.
　　Rita Mae: We met at the hospital. Hello. How are you?
　　Ellen: I remember. How are you?
　　Rita Mae: Oh, and there is Max! Oh! My, how he's grown! A little present for Max.
　　Marilyn: Oh, it's beautiful, Rita Mae! You shouldn't have.
　　Rita Mae: It's nothing. It's just a little present for Max.
　　Ellen: Can I get you some coffee or tea a cold drink, Rita Mae?
　　Rita Mae: Oh, nothing, thank you.
　　Ellen: Well, I will leave you two to talk. Come on, you big guy. Yes, come on. That's it.
　　Eleln: It's nice seeing you. Let me know if you need anything.
　　Rita Mae: Thanks, Ellen.
　　Marilyn: Thanks, Ellen.
　　Rita Mae: OK, Marilyn. You sounded like you've made a decision when you called me. I'm all ears.
　　Marilyn: I have made a decision, Rita Mae. I've decided to stay at home and be a full-time mother.
　　Rita Mae: I'm disappointed, but I respect your decision. If I had a child as cute as Max, I might do the same thing.
　　Marilyn: But I haven't finished telling you the other half of my decision.
　　Rita Mae: The other half?
　　Marilyn: Yes. I think I can stay at home and take care of Max and continue my career.
　　Rita Mae: Sounds interesting. Let me hear it.
　　Marilyn: Do you remember our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique?
　　Rita Mae: I sure do.
　　Marilyn: Why can't I design dresses for you here at home? And make them here. Have the fittings here, too.
　　Rita Mae: And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique.
　　Marilyn: Exactly.
　　Rita Mae: Oh! What kind of dresses would you design?
　　Marilyn: I've thought about that for some time.
　　Rita Mae: Yes?
　　Marilyn: Wedding dresses.
　　Rita Mae: Wedding dresses? Brilliant idea! There's a big market today in wedding dresses.
　　Marilyn: That's what I thought.
　　Rita Mae: I like the idea very much. And if it's successful, we can expand to all kinds dresses.
　　Marilyn: That's what I thought.
　　Rita Mae: As a matter of fact, I have a customer for your first wedding dress. My niece is getting married, and I've been trying to find just the right thing for her. Marilyn, you're going to design my niece's dress. That'll be our first one, and then we'll use it to sell others.
　　Marilyn: Do you really mean it?
　　Rita Mae: I really mean it. It's a simple idea, and it will work. You can certainly design dresses. I know that. And there's no reason why you can't do it from your home.
　　Marilyn: I'm so excited! I can't wait to tell Richard!
　　Rita Mae: If I had a baby like Max, I'd want to stay home and be near him all the time, too. You're making the right decision for Max and for yourself too, Marilyn.
　　Marilyn: It all sounds so easy.
　　Rita Mae: Now the hard work begins.
　　Marilyn: Would you like to see some of my designs that I've been working on?
　　Rita Mae: I'd love to . Ooh! Oh, that's wonderful! Ooh...
　　Episode 23 The Community Center
　　Act 1.
　　Robbie: Morning, Grandpa. Is something the matter, Grandpa?
　　Grandpa: The editorial in this paper has my friend Nat Baker real upset. Ah! I'll read it to you. "The old library building on Chestnut Street, which has been vacant for over a year now, was supposed to be made into a community center to serve the senior citizens as well as the younger people of Riverdale. Due to lack of funds for the repainting of the interior of the building and for the furniture needed, the plans for the community center have been postponed indefinitely." He's coming over to talk about it.
　　Robbie: Is it tat serious a problem, Grandpa?
　　Grandpa: It is. Nat's not as lucky as I am, Robbie. He doesn't have any family with him. He lives alone and depends on places like a community center to be with people- people hi own age.
　　Robbie: But there's the old community center on Elm Street.
　　Grandpa: It's small, and the problem is that it's set up primarily for kids to play. Ping-Pong tables, soda machines, and lots of music. It's too noisy for some older people like Nat.
　　Robbie: I never realized that.
　　Grandpa: It's hard for some older people to take all that noise. That's why the new community center is a good idea. Part of the building for older people, part of the building for younger people.
　　Robbie: I see what you mean.
　　Grandpa: That must be Nat.
　　Robbie: It could be Alexandra. She's coming over this morning to help me with my math.
　　Alexandra: Hi, Robbie.
　　Robbie: Hi, Alexandra. Come on in. Do you want something cold to drink?
　　Axexandra: I'd love some cola, please.
　　Robbie: Cola coming up. I really appreciate you coming over to help with my math. My final exam is next Tuesday.
　　Alexandra: You're so good in all your other subjects. I just can't understand why you have so many problems with math.
　　Grandpa: Hi, Alexandra.
　　Alexandra: Hi, Mr. Stewart.
　　Grandpa: I thought that was Nat Baker who rang the front doorbell. Don't let me interrupt you.
　　Robbie: No problem, Grandpa. We're just having some cola before getting to tough stuff- math.
　　Alexandra: He'll do anything to avoid getting down to math lessons, Mr. Stewart.
　　Grandpa: I was the same way.
　　Robbie: Really, Grandpa?
　　Grandpa: Really. I didn't like math, I wasn't good at it, and I didn't like studying it.
　　Robbie: But you had to be good at math. You graduated from engineering school.
　　Grandpa: I was. But not in high school. For some reason, I couldn't get a handle on it. Then, in college. I became good at it.
　　Alexandra: Then there's hope for Robbie.
　　Robbie: I can't wait. You think I can just skip it now and get to it at college?
　　Alexandra: You'll never get to college to find out, Robbie, if you skip it now.
　　Grandpa: That must be Nat.
　　Alexandra: Sit down, Robbie. Let's get to work.
　　Grandpa: I'd like you to meet my friend Nat Baker. This is Alexandra Pappas, and this is my grandson Robbie, whom I think you've met once twice before.
　　Alexandra: Nice to meet you, Mr. Baker.
　　Robbie: Hi, Mr.Baker. We met before.
　　Nat: Where?
　　Robbie: In town. At the hardware store.
　　Nat: I remember now. Right. Hi. Hello, Alexandra.
　　Grandpa: Don't let us keep you from your math tutoring. Robbie. I know you want to get to it.
　　Robbie: Stay...stay.
　　Alexandra: I told you. He'll use any excuse to avoid math.
　　Nat: Did you read the story in the paper, Malcolm?
　　Grandpa: I did.
　　Nat: It's a serious matter for a lot of us. A serious matter.
　　Grandpa: It is. Come on out to the patio. We'll talk about it out there.
　　Nat: Thanks. Nice to meet you...again.
　　Alexandra: What's the problem?
　　Robbie: Come on? You'll hear about it.
　　Act 2.
　　Nat: There is a way, Malcolm. We get our friends to roll their sleeves up and get to work.
　　Grandpa: It's certainly a good idea. If I could take a look at the place, I could probably tell what it requires to fix it up. How much paint, how many hours of work...
　　Nat: That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.If you would supervise the refurbishing, I'll find the people to help do it.
　　Robbie: I'll help too, Mr.Baker. I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood and collect the furniture we need.
　　Alexandra: I'll help.
　　Grandpa: Tomorrow. Yes. We'll meet tomorrow morning, right here.
　　Robbie: Can we help?
　　Alexandra: I'd really like to.
　　Grandpa: Sure.
　　Nat: We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie. Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture, but to help with the paint job. That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us.
　　Robbie: I'll do it. I'll talk to them.
　　Alexandra: And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan?
　　Grandpa: Come in, come in. Please, come in.
　　Nat: I'd like you to meet my friend Malcolm Stewart. Malcolm, this Joanne Thompson
　　Grandpa: Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you.
　　Joanne: My pleasure, Malcolm.
　　Nat: And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe. He ran the drugstore and used to play drums with the jazz band on weekends.
　　Grandpa: Oh, sure I do. Hi, Abe.
　　Abe: Hello, Mr. Stewart.
　　Grandpa: Malcolm, please.
　　Abe: Hello, Malcolm.
　　Grandpa: Sit down, sit down. Have some coffee. And I've got some delicious Danish pastry for you.
　　Nat: Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra? Weren't they going to be here this morning?
　　Grandpa: I thought so, too. I'm surprised they're not here. Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra. Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but...
　　Nat: It's OK. I'm sure they meant well, but they probably had other things on their minds.
　　Joanne: I understand you used to be in the construction business, Malcolm.
　　Grandpa: I was, indeed.
　　Joanne: I wonder if you would take a look at the old library and make sure that it is in good condition so that we don't have to worry about any structural problems.
　　Grandpa: When can I do that? I'd be happy to.
　　Abe: We've got permission to go inside the old building during the week-Tuesday or Wednesday.
　　Grandpa: That's fine with me. I can do it either day.
　　Joanne: That would be very helpful.
　　Nat: I think the building just needs a good cleaning.
　　Abe: And a good paint job.
　　Joanne: Then we have to furnish it.
　　Grandpa: I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting. They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up.
　　Joanne: Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime, let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have.
　　Grandpa: OK.
　　Nat: Go ahead, Janne.
　　Janne: As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning.
　　Nat: This place can be developed with one real intergenerational program.
　　Grandpa: That's an idea I like. A community center with the kinds of programs that fit everyone.
　　Nat: And programs that don't leave anyone out.
　　Joanne: It's asking a lot. But we can't do it without talking to the young people. Finding out what they want.
　　Grandpa: If only Robbie and Alexandra were here.
　　Nat: Don't be upset, Malcolm. We'll have a chance to talk to them later.
　　Grandpa: It's not like Robbie. If he says he's going to be here, he's here. I wonder what the problem is.
　　Act 3.
　　Robbie: Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late. But Alexandra and I have been busy at work this morning on the community-center project.And we brought someone along who can help. You remember Charles Maxwell, Grandpa? He's the editor of the Riverdale paper. He wrote some nice articles on Mom when she was running for the school board.
　　Grandpa: Yes, I remember. You were a great help.
　　Maxwell: Hi, Mr. Stewart. Hope to be a bigger help on the new community-center project. From what Robbie and Alexandra have told me, you people are making one big story.
　　Grandpa: Let me introduce you, Mr. Maxwell. This is Nat Baker, who's responsible for this meeting, and this is Joanne Thompson-and Abe Lucas, who used to run the drugstore in town.
　　Maxwell: Robbie and Alexandra told me what you need to fix up the old library. I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you.
　　Grandpa: Let's go. What are your questions?
　　Maxwell: OK. Now, I have...first...a couple of questions here. Have you talked to the community council? And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection?
　　Maxwell: OK, what do you need most of all?
　　Grandpa: People power. Men and women, young and old, to give us their time.
　　Maxwell: To do what?
　　Joanne: To help scrub the building interior clean.
　　Nat: So that we can repaint it.
　　Maxwell: And you also need bodies to do repainting?
　　Grandpa: That's right. And we'll also need some ladders and some brushes and some paint.
　　Maxwell: When do you need the volunteers, and where do they report?
　　Grandpa: I've got the council to agree to open the building for us on the next four weekends.
　　Maxwell: How about furnishings? Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper?
　　Joanne: Yes. Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with.
　　Maxwell: Let's see. Four desks. Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs. Six table lamps. Three end tables .One piano. This is a good start. These items shouldn't be difficult to come by once I print the article in the paper. This community has always been very generous.
　　Grandpa: I agree, Mr. Maxwell.
　　Maxwell: What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed, we need to put together volunteers from the various generations of future users.
　　Grandpa: That's right.
　　Nat: And without their energy and stamina, there's no way we can complete this project.
　　Maxwell: I've got it. Now give m some information about how you see the building being used.
　　Joanne: Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area...
　　Grandpa: It's here, Robbie. Charles Maxwell lived up to his word. "At the Stewart family home on Linden street yesterday, a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered to plan the refurbishing of the old library to transform it into a new community center. The original plan by the council was tabled because of lack for funds.The new plan needs you . You could call it a community unity plan. It needs your time, and it needs your energy. And it needs your contributions of furniture, paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera. A list of these items and a volunteer form can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices. By working together, this community can do anything to benefit its citizens, and we know you will all work together towards refurbishing the old library and making it a new community center. Charles Maxwell, Editor."

　　Act 1.
　　Robbie: Hi, Mom.
　　Ellen: Hi, Robbie You're home from school early.
　　Robbie: Yeah, they're getting the assembly hall ready for the graduation ceremony, so we all got to go home early. Too noisy to study.
　　Ellen: Well, now that you're here, you can help me with dinner. I need those potatoes peeled and sliced.
　　Robbie: Mom, give me a break Alexandra's coming over to help me study for my math final.
　　Ellen: Well, in that case, you can wash the dishes and clean up after dinner.
　　Robbie: Can I invite Alexandra to stay for dinner?
　　Ellen: Of course.
　　Robbie: Thanks, Mom.
　　Ellen: You an Alexandra have become good friends, haven't you?
　　Robbie: Yes. I like her.She's a terrific person. I'm going to miss her when she goes back to Greece.
　　Ellen: Would you like to give her a little farewell party?
　　Robbie: Mom, that would be terrific! Maybe we could make it a surprise.
　　Ellen: Oh, I don't know. Surprise parties don't always work out.
　　Robbie: Well, we could tell her it's a graduation party for me. When Alexandra arrives, we'll surprise her.
　　Ellen: Well, I suppose that might work.
　　Robbie: I'd like to give her a nice going-away present.
　　Ellen: Fine.
　　Robbie: There's only one problem.
　　Ellen: What's that?
　　Robbie: I'm broke. I should have saved some money.
　　Ellen: I'm sure Alexandra would be happy with something simple, Robbie.
　　Robbie: I know. But, well, I'd like to give her something nice to remember me by. Maybe I could borrow some money from you and Dad.
　　Ellen: It's all right with me if it's all right with your dad.
　　Robbie: Thanks, Mom. I'll talk to him. Is he still in his office?
　　Ellen: I think so.
　　Robbie: Thanks, Mom.
　　Ellen: Robbie! Good luck!
　　Molly: Here are the X-rays you wanted , Dr. Stewart.
　　Philip: Oh. Thank you, Molly. Now, let me check them.
　　Molly: What do you think?
　　Philip: I don't see any breaks or fractures. Well, well. Thank you, Molly.
　　Molly: Thank you.
　　Philip: Come in! Hi, Son.
　　Robbie: Hi, Dad. Am I interrupting you?
　　Philip: No, no, no, no,. What's up?
　　Robbie: Can we talk?
　　Philip: Sure.
　　Robbie: I need some help.
　　Philip: Well, that's what fathers are for.
　　Robbie: Well, before I go to college, I have the whole summer...
　　Philip: Yes...
　　Robbie: And I'm planning to get a job for the summer.
　　Philip: And What sort of job?
　　Robbie: I applied for a job as a lifeguard at the community pool.
　　Philip: Sounds pretty good.
　　Robbie: Yes. I'll be earning pretty good money if I get it. But right now, I'm kind of short of cash.
　　Philip: Who isn't?
　　Robbie: And my friend Alexandra is going to Greece...
　　Philip: Nice girl. We'll all miss her.
　　Robbie: Mom says we can her a going-away surprise party.
　　Philip: Good idea.
　　Robbie: And I'd like to get her a nice gift...
　　Philip: What'd you have in mind?
　　Robbie: Well, a wristwatch, so she'll think of me when she looks at the time. Nothing flashy or expensive. Something simple-but a good one.
　　Philip: Sounds fine, Robbie.
　　Robbie: Well, I saw a nice watch. But I'll need a loan. If you could lend me the money, I could pay you back out of my lifeguard salary.
　　Philip: Well, I guess your mother and I can manage it. When do you need the money?
　　Robbie: Would tomorrow be OK?
　　Philip: You've got it.
　　Robbie: Thanks, Dad.
　　Philip: My pleasure, Son. Oh, and, Robbie...
　　Robbie: Yes?
　　Philip: You'll probably want the family car so you can drive her home after the party.
　　Robbie: Could I?
　　Philip: If you drive carefully.
　　Robbie: I will. Thanks, Dad.
　　Philip: My pleasure.
　　Robbie: You're OK, Dad.
　　Philip: You're not so bad yourself, Son.
　　Act 2.
　　Alexandra: You ready for the next problem?
　　Robbie: You know what? I can't look at another number. How about a lemonade break?
　　Alexandra: Sure.
　　Robbie: Oh, by he way, when is your plane reservation for your flight to Athens?
　　Alexandra: Sunday. Why?
　　Robbie: Would you be able to come over Saturday night?
　　Alexandra: Yes. I should be finished packing by then.
　　Robbie: My folks are giving me a little graduation party.
　　Alexandra: Terrific!
　　Robbie: I'll pick you up.
　　Alexandra: That isn't necessary.
　　Robbie: My dad's letting me borow the car.
　　Alexandra: Oh, well, that would be very nice.
　　Robbie: About eight 0'clock?
　　Alexandra: Eight 0'clock is fine.
　　Robbie: Great! It's a date.

　　Alexandra: I'm going to miss all of you. You've been like a second family to me.
　　Robbie: We're going to miss you.
　　Alexandra: Maybe you could come to visit me in Greece?
　　Robbie: I'm counting on it.
　　Alexandra: Wonderful! Are you excited about graduating from high school?
　　Robbie: Sure...and a little scared.
　　Alexandra: Scared? Why?
　　Robbie: Aren't you a little scared?
　　Alexandra: I was when I first came to the United States. I'd never been away from home, and I didn't know what it would be like. But then I found out that people are the same everywhere once you get to know them.
　　Robbie: I'm glad I got to know you.
　　Alexandra: Thatnk you. I'm glad I got to know You-and your family.
　　Robbie: Wouldn't it be nice if we could skip the examinations and get right to the graduation party?
　　Alexandra: It would be very nice. But that isn't the way it works. So...back to work.
　　Alexandra: Good night, Robbie. Good night, Mrs.Stewart. Thank you for dinner.
　　Ellen: Good night, Alexandra.Will you be all right?
　　Alexandra: Yes.The Molinas are waiting for me.
　　Robbie: Good night, Alexandra. I'll pick you up on Saturday night, OK?
　　Alexandra: Yes. Eight 0'clock.
　　Alexandra: I have to run.
　　Allen: Good night, Robbie. She's really a good friend, isn't she?
　　Robbie: Yeah.
　　Ellen: You are going to miss her.
　　Robbie: Am I going to miss her?
　　Ellen: That's what I said! You are going to miss her!
　　Robbie: I'm going to miss her, and my math teacher's going to miss her.
　　Ellen: Well, you can write to her.
　　Robbie: It's not the same.
　　Mike: How does that look, Rob?
　　Robbie: Great! Pass me the hammer.
　　Mike: You got it!
　　Sandra: You're sure Alexandra's going to be surprised?
　　Robbie: Absolutely. She has no idea that the party is in her honor.
　　Mike: Millie, did you bring the papes for dancing?
　　Millie: They're in my bag.
　　Mike: What did you bring?
　　Millie: Some rock 'n' roll.
　　Robbie: Perfect! Alexandra will love it! I can't wait to see her face when she walks in here tonight.
　　Mike: What about the cake?
　　Robbie: My mom's decorating it right now.
　　Ellen: Robbie, there's a phone call for you. It's Alexandra. She sounds upset.
　　Robbie: OK. Thanks, Mom. I'll take it in there. Hi, Alexandra. What? You what? Oh no!
　　Act 3.
　　Millie: How about some music?
　　Sandra: No, let's wait till Robbie gets back from the airport.
　　Millie: Did she say why she had to leave today?
　　Mike: She told Robbie that her flight tomorrow was canceled, so she had to take an earlier flight today.
　　Millie: This is terrible.
　　Mike: Well, that must be him.
　　Sandra: Why is he blowing his horn like that?
　　Mike: I don't know. Maybe he's angry.
　　Sandra: Do you think we should take down the decorations? They'll just make him sad.
　　Mike: Too late now. We should have done it sooner. Oh, here he comes.
　　Mike: Hi, How'd it go?
　　Robbie: OK, I guess. Especially when Alexandra gave me a surprise...
　　Mike: Yeah? What was it?
　　Robbie: This!
　　Mike: Alexandra!
　　Sandra: Hi! What happened?
　　Alexandra: I called my parents from the airport. When I told them my friends were giving me a party, they insisted that I stay. So now I'm taking a flight on Monday instead.
　　Mike: That's great! Terrific!
　　Sandra: But how did you know the party was for you?
　　Alexandra: Well, Robbie told me when he gave me this.
　　Sandra: Oh, it's so pretty!
　　Alexandra: It's lovely, Robbie.
　　Millie: All right! Now we can really start the party!
　　Alexandra: No. Would you mind? I'd like to say something first.
　　Philip: Hear, hear!
　　Alexandra: I should just like to thank all of you, my friends, who have made my stay in the Unite States so wonderful. And to Robbie and the Stwart family for opening their home to me.
　　Robbie: We should thank you. You're a real friend!
　　Alexandra: And I also have a little surprise for you, Robbie. A little going-away present.
　　Robbie: Thank you.
　　Alexandra: Open it, please. I think you might be amused.
　　Robbie: OK. I can't believe it!
　　Alexandra: I guess we were thinking the same thought.
　　Robbie: You had it engraved!
　　Ellen: Read it, Robbie.
　　Robbie: "In friendship, always. Alexandra." I knew we thought alike, but this is too much! Thank you.
　　Mike: All right! Let's have some music!
　　Robbie: Miss Pappas?
　　Alexandra: Mr.Stewart...
　　Philip: Mrs. Stewart, may I have this dance?
　　Ellen: My pleasure, Doctor.
　　Episode 25 Country Music
　　Act 1.
　　Richard: Hot dogs. I love hot dogs. There is nothing better than a hot dog in the country.
　　Ellen: Hot dogs and mustard.
　　Richard: Cooked outdoors over an open fire. I wish I had one now.
　　Ellen: Do you remember when Daddy and I used to take you and Susan and Robbie to Jones Beach?
　　Richard: Oh, I sure do.
　　Ellen: We'd wait until dark and make a fire, and we'd cook the hot dogs. Oh, don't forget the mustard. And, oh, does anybody want ketchup?
　　Richard: I might as well take it along. And now to make sure we've got the hamburger patties. I have to remember to put them in the bag tomorrow morning before we leave.
　　Ellen: I'll remind you, Richard.
　　Richard: Mom, we really appreciate your taking care of Max for the weekend and giving up your free time.
　　Ellen: I love doing it. Susan and Harry have a sitter for Michelle in the city, and I'm taking care of Max. It's no big deal. I am happy to do it for you.
　　Richard: I guess Max is asleep by now. He's not crying anymore.
　　Ellen: Oh, poor baby. He's teething.
　　Marilyn: Well, he's asleep-finally. I feel so bad for him. It hurts so much when a baby gets his first teeth.
　　Ellen: He'll be fine, Marilyn.
　　Richard: Well, he wakes up several times during the night, and the pain is so bad.
　　Marilyn: I'm really concerned about going away for the weekend, Ellen, and leaving you with the full responsibility of taking care of Max. Especially with his teething. I wish he felt better.
　　Ellen: Please don't worry, Marilyn. Remember your father-in-law's a pediatrician. We have a live-in doctor if there's a problem I can't handle.
　　Richard: I agree, Marilyn. We really don't have to be overly concerned.
　　Richard: I'll go upstairs and stay with him until he falls asleep again.
　　Marilyn: Thanks, Richard. Try putting him across your lap on his stomach. He likes that.
　　Richard: I"ll try it.
　　Ellen: When are Susan and Harry Picking you up, Marilyn?
　　Marilyn: They're coming by at six tomorrow morning, so we can get an early start.
　　Ellen: That's nice. And you'll have a full day in the country.
　　Marilyn: And a full night. Tomorrow night we'll be camping out in tents.
　　Ellen: And coming home on Sunday?
　　Marilyn: We'll be heading back late in the afternoon.
　　Ellen: You're going to have the time of your lives. Camping out is such great fun.
　　Marilyn: We'll have a great time camping out, I'm sure. But I'm still a little worried about you, Ellen.
　　Ellen: It will be my great pleasure, Marilyn. Remember, it's only one night.
　　Richard: He's asleep. I think he'll sleep through the night now.
　　Marilyn: Thanks, honey. I hope he's good when we're away.
　　Richard: Well, so do I. Now, to check the list of things we need for the camping trip. We need to bring a flashlight.
　　Ellen: It's in the right-hand drawer, next to the bottle openers.
　　Richard: Do we have a bottle opener on the list, Marilyn?
　　Marilyn: No.No bottle opener. Is that one of the things Susan and Harry are bringing?
　　Richard: No. And we're bring the ketchup, mustard, relish-all that stuff. And cooking utensils. Well, here's the bottle poener, and here's the flashlight.
　　Ellen: Matches.
　　Marilyn: Matches?
　　Richard: Yes, of course. For when we build our campfire. I can't build a fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together.
　　Marilyn: And don't forget your camera and film, Richard.
　　Richard: All packed and ready.
　　Marilyn: And let's not forget our cassette player and some tapes. Some music tapes and some blank tapes so that we can record our thoughts about the trip.
　　Ellen: Oh, that's a nice idea. An audio diary.
　　Marilyn: That's what I thought.
　　Richard: Got it! The cassette player and the tapes.
　　Act 2.
　　Susan: Oh, I love it! To be away from the city on such a beautiful day is my idea of heaven! The grass. The trees. The fresh air.
　　Harry: I told you you'd like it. I've been doing this for years.
　　Richard: You have the spirit of a teenager, Susan. Wait till you see yourself jumping around.
　　Marilyn: That's what I love about Susan. She works hard. She plays hard. She's a real Stewart.
　　Harry: Come on, Richard. Help me get this stuff out of the car.
　　Richard: Where does it go?
　　Harry: Well, we'll put everything over there. We'll set up our tents over there by the edge of the woods. Then we'll be able to make our fire there where it's safe.
　　Richard: Oh, there's our table and benches. All set for eating.
　　Harry: That's what makes this spot so good.
　　Marilyn: Is anybody hungry?
　　Susan: I am.
　　Harry: We just got here.
　　Susan: When you're out in the fresh air like this, it makes you hungry. Aren't you hungry, Marilyn?
　　Marilyn: I sure am. How about you, Richard?
　　Richard: Starving.
　　Harry: You guys are like three kids.
　　Richard: Aren't you hungry, Harry?
　　Harry: Well, yeah. Now that you mention it, I guess I am. I mean, how could a guy not be hungry with all this talk about eating?
　　Marilyn: Where's the bag with the chicken salad sandwiches?
　　Harry: Right here, next to the ice packs. Here. Put the tablecloth on the picnic table, and I will bring the cola and the plastic cups.
　　Harry: Well, how do you like it so far?
　　Richard: I've never been more relaxed.
　　Marilyn: Me, Neither.
　　Susan: I wish we had brought Michelle, Harry. She would have loved it.
　　Marilyn: Oh, You're right. I wish we had brought Max.
　　Richard: Marilyn, Susan, let's not begin to worry about Michelle and Max. We're having a good time, and they're in good hands.
　　Harry: Richard is right. Are you having a good time, Susan? You haven't answered my question.
　　Susan: I am having a good time, Harry. I promise not to think about the city. We're in the country. Let's all just enjoy this wonderful place and this wonderful weather.
　　Harry: Good.
　　Susan: This is heaven, Harry! It was such a great idea to spend the weekend this way.
　　Harry: Thanks, Susan. I thought you'd all like it.
　　Susan: Like it? I love it! Listen to the sounds of the summer that surround us. It's so calming.
　　Harry: I've always liked camping out. Away from the telephones and account books. It's refreshing for me. I always go back to the city in a wonderful state of mind.
　　Susan: We've only been here for a day, and I've completely forgotten about all my business problems. The office seems so far away.
　　Harry: I'm glad you like it, Susan. We'll spend many more weekends like this.
　　Susan: And next time we'll bring Michelle, I wish she were here with us to enjoy the country.
　　Harry: And next time we'll bring Michelle.
　　Marilyn: Just listen to the sound. It's so soothing.
　　Richard: I can hardly keep my eyes open. If only we could bottle the fresh air.
　　Marilyn: Wouldn't it be wonderful?
　　Richard: We could call it "Deep Sleep Country Air."
　　Marilyn: It puts you to sleep. So does the sound. I've bee having a hard time keeping my eyes open just listening to it. It's like a special music.
　　Richard: Too bad we can't bottle the sound.
　　Marilyn: But we can!
　　Richard: Can what?
　　Marilyn: Bottle the sound.
　　Richard: What are you talking about?
　　Richard: Oh, yeah? Great idea! Let's do it!
　　Act 3.
　　Marilyn: I'm so glad everyone is asleep. I thought Max would be crying, and everybody would be a wake.
　　Richard: What did I tell you? Nothing to worry about.
　　Susan: I'm sure everything is fine. My mother knows all there is to know about taking care of babies, I assure you.
　　Harry: Let's put some of this stuff away and then take off. We've got a forty-minute drive into the city.
　　Ellen: Welcome home-and I do mean welcome home.
　　Richard: Something wrong?
　　Ellen: Oh, nothing's wrong, Richard. Believe me, Max is fine. But his teeth hurt, and he just can't get to sleep, poor dear.
　　Susan: Neither can you.
　　Marilyn: Oh, I feel so bad.
　　Ellen: Oh, I'm fine. How was your weekend?
　　Harry: We had a great time, Mom.
　　Richard: It was wonderful. The weather couldn't have been better.
　　Ellen: It was nice here, too.
　　Marilyn: Did you get a chance to get outside at all?
　　Ellen: Oh, yes. Grandpa helped me yesterday afternoon. I went to the supermarket to get a few things, and I stayed out an extra half hour. The village was filled people-the weather was so nice.
　　Richard: Harry's a professional camper, Mom. He knows all there is to know, and he made the weekend very easy for us to enjoy.
　　Harry: Come on. You all helped.
　　Susan: You were wonderful, Harry!
　　Marilyn: Why don't you go to your room, Mom, and get some sleep.
　　Ellen: Oh, I'm fine. Tell me more about your weekend. Did you do anything special?
　　Susan: Lots of special country things. We picked flowers.
　　Marilyn: And we brought some home for you. It was so nice to be out in the country.
　　Ellen: They smell wonderful.
　　Marilyn: Everything smelled so special. It would have been great if we had been able to bottle the smells.
　　Harry: It would be a great business if you could do that.
　　Ellen: Oh!
　　Marilyn: Uh, we're home now, Ellen. We'll take care of it.
　　Richard: I'll take care of it. Let's see if it works.
　　Ellen: What's that?
　　Richard: A little we'd better head home. It's getting late, and we have a bit of a drive.
　　Harry: Well, all your things are inside. There's your sleeping bag.
　　Marilyn: Oh, thanks, Harry.
　　Harry: Say good-bye to Richard. We'll call you all tomorrow night.
　　Marilyn: Good-bye.
　　Susan: Bye, Mom.
　　Ellen: Bye-bye.
　　Marilyn: Bye.
　　Ellen: I'm so tired I think I'm overtired. I don't know if I can get to sleep.
　　Ellen: Max has stopped crying.
　　Marilyn: Yes. It works!
　　Richard: It works!
　　Ellen: What works?
　　Richard: This.
　　Ellen: Oh. Oh, where did you get that? It sounds so nice. I think I'm falling asleep.
　　Richard: Like Max did.
　　Richard: Good night.
　　Marilyn: Good night. Sounds of the country. The soothing sounds of the country.
　　Episode 26 Opening Night
　　Act 1.
　　Carlson: A little further to the right, Tom.
　　Tom: Is this OK?
　　Carlson: Good. What do you think ,Richard?
　　Richard: I like it there.
　　Carlson: It's the first thing people will see when they come in. It sets the tone for the whole show. The next thing they'll see is this enlargement with the words Family Album, U.S.A.
　　Richard: I can't believe this is really happening!
　　Carlson: You've earned it. Years of work went into these pictures.
　　Richard: I know, but it's still a dream come true.
　　Carlson: Well, remember, we're not sure what the critics are going to write about your show yet. And you never know what the man from the New York Times is going to say about it.
　　Richard: Are you worried?
　　Carlson: I always worry. The reviews of this show are important for the sales of your book.
　　Richard: When do we see the reviews?
　　Carlson: Soon. One of the critics is coming over this morning for a preview. I hope he's in a good mood.
　　Richard: So do I. Marilyn and I hope to use money from the sales of this book to buy a new house.
　　Carlson: The book will be a success. And the show will help promote it.
　　Richard: Speaking of promoting the book, do I really have to autograph copies for the guests at the opening?
　　Carlson: It's common practice.
　　Richard: I feel uncomfortable about it.
　　Carlson: A lot of people come to openings just so they can get the autograph of somebody who may be famous someday.
　　Richard: Couldn't we wait until I'm famous?
　　Carlson: A little further back, Tom. It's too close to the refreshments.
　　Richard: No, I think this one belongs in the "people-at-work" section.
　　Carlson: You may be right. Try it there, Tom
　　Tom: Right.
　　Carlson: Nervous about the opening tonight?
　　Richard: Nervous? Me? No. I'm scared to death.
　　Carlson: How about guests? How many people will you be bringing?
　　Richard: Well, my family, I guess. My wife Marilyn, my father and mother, my brother Robbie, my sister and her husband and their daughter. And my grandfather. Is that too many?
　　Carlson: No such thing as" too many" at an opening.
　　Richard: I hope they like it.
　　Carlson: Your family or the pubic?
　　Richard: Everybody. But especially my family. They've stood by me through all this.
　　Carlson: I'm sure they'll like it.
　　Mitchell: Harvey, how are you?
　　Carlson: Mitchell, so nice of you to come. Richard, this is Mitchell Johnson. Mitchell is one of the most important syndicated reviewers in the country.
　　Mitchell: Well, you're the young man who did all this.
　　Richard: I'm afraid so.
　　Mitchell: Nice to meet you.
　　Richard: Nict to meet you, Mr. Johnson.
　　Carlson: Mitchell has always encouraged new talent.
　　Mitchell: Well...you mind if I look around and see what it says to me?
　　Carlson: Be our guest.
　　Mitchell: Mm-hmm, hmm, uh-huh.
　　Richard: What does that mean when he goes, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,mm-hmm"?
　　Carlson: It probably means he's clearing his throat. I don't know.
　　Tom: I don't care what the critics say, Mr.Stewart. Your work is brilliant.
　　Richard: Thank you, Tom.
　　Carlson: Tom is studying photography at NYU. He's working with me during the summer months as an intern.
　　Richard: Oh, really? I'd like to see your work.
　　Tom: It's not good enough to show. I'm still learning.
　　Richard: Oh, I'd still like to see your work. You may be the next Ansel Adams and not even know it.
　　Tom: If you really mean it, I'll bring some of my pictures into the gallery.
　　Richard: I do mean it.
　　Mitchell: Very interesting pictures, Mr.Stewart. You have a most unusual eye.
　　Richard: Thank you. I hope that's a compliment.
　　Mitchell: It is.
　　Carlson: Are you going to be reviewing the show, Mitchell?
　　Mitchell: Oh, yes. It's definitely worth reviewing.
　　Carlson: Favorably?
　　Mitchell: Oh, you know I never answer that question, Harvey. I'd like an advance copy of the book, though, so I can study it.
　　Carlson: I have an autographed one in my office. Tom, would you give Mr.Johnson the copy of Richard's book on my desk?
　　Tom: Just follow me, Mr.Johnson.
　　Mitchell: Sure.
　　Richard: Do you think he liked my photographs?
　　Carlson: We'll know when tonight's papers come out. Keep your fingers crossed.
　　Act 2.
　　Marilyn: Do you like the dress?
　　Richard: I love it.
　　Marilyn: I designed it myself.
　　Richard: It's beautiful.
　　Marilyn: Are you ready? We're supposed to be there before the guests arrive.
　　Richard: I know. I know. Help me with this tie, will you? Honey, I'm scared to death.
　　Marilyn: But this is what you've been working for all these years.
　　Richard: No, no. I worked to put together a book of photographs. This is show business.
　　Marilyn: Well, it's all part of the same job. Just relax and enjoy it.
　　Richard: You're right. I earned this, and I'm going to enjoy it. As soon as I recover from my nervous breakdown.
　　Marilyn: What are you afraid of?
　　Richard: Everything. A critic was there this morning. He probably hates my work. I have to sign copies of my book for a lot of people I never met before. My new shoes hurt my feet...
　　Marilyn: You're going to be a great success. Are you ready?
　　Richard: As soon as I get these cuff links on.
　　Marilyn: Let me help. Mom and Dad are already on their way down to the gallery.
　　Marilyn: There! You look very attractive.
　　Richard: Thank you. Well, I suppose I'v run out of excuses.
　　Marilyn: Mm-hmm. Let's go...
　　Richard: Oh, one minute. Before we go to the gallery, I just want to tell you that I never could have done this book without your help and your love. I appreciate it.
　　Marilyn: Thanks. Now, no more stalling.
　　Marilyn: What is it?
　　Richard: There's nobody here!
　　Marilyn: Of course not, Richard. Your show doesn't begin until eight thirty.
　　Richard: Oh. Right.
　　Carlson: Richard! Welcome! Good luck tonight!
　　Richard: Well, thanks. This is my publisher. Harvey Carlson. You've met my wife Marilyn...
　　Carlson: Charmed.
　　Marilyn: Hi.
　　Richard: My mother, Ellen Stewart. Harvey Carlson.
　　Carlson: It's good to meet you.
　　Ellen: It's nice to meet you.
　　Richard: This is my father, Dr.Philip Stewart...
　　Philip: Nice to meet you, Mr. Carlson.
　　Richard: My brother Robbie...
　　Robbie: Hi.
　　Carlson: Hi.
　　Richard: And this is my sister Susan and her husband Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.
　　Carlson: It's nice to meet you.
　　Richard: And this gentleman is my grandfather, Malcolm Stewart.
　　Carlson: Welcome, Mr.Stewart. Well, make yourselves comfortable. There are hors d'oeuvres at the table, fruit punch at the bar. Help yourselves. Can I get you something, Mr.Setwart?
　　Grandpa: No, thank you.
　　Carlson: You can feel very proud of your grandson, Mr.Stewart.
　　Grandpa: I do. I'm proud of all my grandchildren, Mr.Carlson.
　　Carlson: Of course. Feel free to look around. If you need anything, just ask.
　　Grandpa: Thank you.
　　Richard: Harvey?
　　Carlson: Yes?
　　Richard: Did Mitchell Johnson's review come out yet?
　　Carlson: Not yet. The newpapers don't come out till about ten 0'clock. When they come out, we'll get it.
　　Richard: Thanks.
　　Carlson: Ready?
　　Richard: Yes. Have the people arrived?
　　Carlson: The guests are waiting. Tom's about to open the doors. Good luck! And stop worrying! They're going to love it.
　　Act 3.
　　Richard: What's this?
　　Carlson: Read it.
　　Richard: I can't. Would you read it, Marilyn?
　　Marilyn: "Richard Stewart's show at the Carlson Gallery is a collection of photographs from his new book entitled Family Album, U.S.A. There is power and beauty in. Mr. Stewart's work, and his book introduces us to a remarkable new talent." Oh, Richard, it's wonderful!
　　Carlson: Congratulations!
　　Richard: Wow! I'm overwhelmed.
　　Carlson: Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention for a moment, please? I hope you're all enjoying the exhibition. I know that I am. And I would like to introduce the young man who spent the last five years taking these remarkable pictures and writing the background for Family. Album, U.S.A-Mr Richard Stewart.
　　Richard: Hello. I want to thank all of you for coming here tonight. I'd like to thank Harvey Carlson for his faith in my project. But most of all, I would like to thank my family for their love and support all through this adventure. Thank you.
　　Richard: Oh, I'm glad this's over.
　　Tom: Would you mind?
　　Richard: Oh, not at all.
　　Tom: Thanks.
　　Richard: Our pleasure. Hope it wins a Pulitzer Prize.
　　Tom: I'll settle for an "A" in my photography course.
　　Carlson: Ah, Richard, Marilyn, I want you to meet John O'Neill.
　　Richard: Oh,how do you do ?
　　Marilyn: Nice to meet you.
　　O'Neill: I've been looking forward to meeting your husband, Mrs. Stewart. I'm really impressed by your show.
　　Richard: Thank you.
　　O'Neill: In fact, I'd like your autograph.
　　Richard: Oh, well, really...
　　O'Neill: On a contract.
　　Richard: What's this about, Harvey?
　　Carlson: Mr. O'Neill is the publisher of several magazines.
　　Marilyn: Of course. I've seen you on television.
　　Carlson: Mr. O'Neill was so impressed with your work that he wants to develop it into a magazine concept.
　　Richard: Well, that sounds very exciting, but where would I fit into the plan?
　　O'Neill: I'd like you to be the photo editor of the magazine.
　　Marilyn: Oh, Richard, how exciting!
　　Carlson: It's a wonderful opportunity, Richard.
　　Richard: Hold on. Wait a minute, please.
　　Carlson: What's the problem, Richard?
　　Richard: The problem is that I'm a photographer, not an editor. I like what I do. In fact, I love what I do...which is going out with a camera and a roll of film and seeing the wonder of humanity. Now, I appreciate your offer, but I've worked so hard on Family Album, U.S.A. and I'm giving some thought to a new book on a different subject. I'm flattered, but I enjoy taking pictures, and I want to continue doing that. Thank you, but I'm happy being a photographer.
　　O'Neill: I understand, Richard.
　　Carlson: Richard, I know your next book will be a success. Congratulations!
　　Richard: Thanks.
　　Marilyn: You're a real Stewart!
　　Richard: Thanks.
